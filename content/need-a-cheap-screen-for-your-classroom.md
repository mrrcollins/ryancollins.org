Over at [instructables][] [Saul][] has posted his directions for using
Tyvek wrapping for aÂ [Tyvek Projector Screen][![][]]. Since this is used
for wrapping houses it is very inexpensive and somewhat durable. He used
a pipe in one end to keep it taunt. From reading the comments there are
ways of purchasing it without the logo or using other materials, such as
black out clothe, that is available in white.
