Google, at <cite>[Google For Educators][], is now offering educational
resources for using Google products in the classroom:</cite>

> Google recognizes the central role that teachers play in breaking down
> the barriers between people and information, and we support educators
> who work each day to empower their students and expand the frontiers
> of human knowledge. This website is one of the ways we're working to
> bolster that support and explore how Google and educators can work
> together.As a start, we're inviting you to share your best ideas for
> using technology to innovate in the classroom. To your left, you'll
> find a teacher's guide to 12 Google products, including basic
> information about each tool, examples of how educators are using them,
> and lesson ideas. You'll also find lesson plans and videos from our
> partners at Discovery Education focusing on two of our most popular
> teaching tools: Google Earth and Google SketchUp.

When I first read it I was expecting a more general view of Internet  
resources that may be used in the classroom, but limiting it to Google
products still gives teachers and students some very cool software they
can use. Google Earth is talked about a lot, but I think a lot of people
are missing out learning opportunities that can take place with [Google
SketchUp][].<cite>
