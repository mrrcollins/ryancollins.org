Reading over at [Slashdot.org][] and the original article at
[ScienceDaily][] it appears that film enjoyment can be contagious:

> Over the course of the film, movie-watchers influence one another and

Can this research be applied to the classroom? We've all taught at least
one lesson where it seems like everything clicked. The students were
engaged, on task, and excited. Even the most prepared teacher can have a
lesson go south, but it appears that a lesson might be saved by
"groupthink". By slowly bringing the class on task, it can cause a
snowball effect, not only increasing the enjoyment of the students but
also increasing their retention.

I'm reminded of this [post by Miguel Guhlin][]

Although a teacher can't "fire" their students, a teacher needs to be
aware of the negative influence those off-task students are having on
the rest of the class.
