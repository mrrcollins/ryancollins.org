I have multiple email accounts, and read it from various devices. It's
all based on [IMAP][], so folders, messages read, etc. stay the same
from device to device. The problem I was having was when I'd read a
message on my [iPod Touch][] or [Samsung Omnia][] (a [Windows Mobile][]
cellphone). Sometimes it would be a message that I would need to act on,
but can't right at that moment. A lot of email clients allow you to flag
a message so you can remember to go back to it, but that's not an option
on my [iPod Touch][] or the [Omnia][Samsung Omnia]. At first I'd just
mark the messages unread, but that also gets messy (not knowing if I
have new messages because of the unread indicator).

What I've done now is to create a folder called Flagged for each one of
my email accounts. Now when I get a message I need to act upon it later,
I'll move it to this Flagged folder.

Sometimes I will just forward the message to my [Remember the Milk][]
account, but that's a post for another day. :-)
