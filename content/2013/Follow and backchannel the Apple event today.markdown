I've set up an IRC bot to feed MacRumorsLive Twitter account into the [#eduk8me IRC channel on Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23eduk8me&uio=d4). You can use the [web client](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23eduk8me&uio=d4) or any IRC client to connect to the #eduk8me channel on Freenode. 

(I'm at the Ohio ITSCO Leadership Symposium, so I don't know how much time I'll have to join. :-( )
