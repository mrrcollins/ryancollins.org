[Attention, Teachers! Why Students Are Bored | Grant Wiggins](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grant-wiggins/why-students-are-bored_b_4274474.html):

>PowerPoint. Yes, I agree that PowerPoint is a very valuable tool, but this only applies in certain situations. When a teacher writes paragraphs upon paragraphs on a single PowerPoint slide, and then proceeds to read them all verbatim to "teach" the class, I completely zone out.

>And please, teachers, take special heed on the PowerPoints. This was the #1 disliked practice in our student survey:

>**Too much text on each slide; and reading directly from the slide.**
