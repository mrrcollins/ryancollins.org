[Online education… and zombies: AMC turns The Walking Dead into a free online course](http://gigaom.com/2013/09/03/online-education-and-zombines-amc-turns-the-walking-dead-into-an-online-course/)

>Ahead of the new season of its hit TV show The Walking Dead, cable network AMC has partnered with education technology company Instructure and the University of California at Irvine for an online course based on the popular television series.

>The eight-week course, titled “Society, Science, Survival: Lessons from AMC’s ‘The Walking Dead,’” will include content, video clips and examples from the show, as well as possible participation from the actors.

I hope they discuss how the zombies still can be a threat two years later, wouldn't they have decomposed by now?
