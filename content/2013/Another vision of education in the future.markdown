[An Infographic on the future of education](http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2013/08/map-education-technology-through-2040-infographic)

>The future is about access, anywhere learning and collaboration, both locally and globally. Teaching and learning is going to be social. Schools of the future could have a traditional cohort of students, as well as online only students who live across the country or even the world. Things are already starting to move this way with the emergence of massive open online courses (MOOCs).

>For me, the future of technology in education is the cloud.

The infographic is much better than the article linked in the post to the Guardian. 

In the near future, native apps are going to become more and more prevalent. That's why Google is putting [Native Client](https://developers.google.com/native-client/) inside of Chrome. And the cloud will be less and less important until cellular companies loosen up the bandwidth.

P.S. And interactive whiteboards end in 2012...
