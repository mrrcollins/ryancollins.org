[Google Drive Workflows to Use with Students](http://kylepace.wordpress.com/2013/10/31/google-drive-workflows-to-use-with-students/)

>When youâ€™re wanting to use Google Docs/Drive with students, figuring out which workflow works best for you is one of the biggest challenges. How to access something I want students to turn in to me? How do I put a file out there for my students to have access to?

I would add [Doctopus](http://www.youpd.org/doctopus) and [Goobric](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goobric/cepmakjlanepojocakadfpohnhhalfol?hl=en) to that toolbox.
