Do you have a question about the usage of English, such as **[Should I put a
comma before the last item in a
list?](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/412/should-i-put-a-comma-before-the-last-item-in-a-list)**,**[What
is the correct way to pluralize an
acronym?](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/503/what-is-the-correct-way-to-pluralize-an-acronym)**,
or **["My friends and I" vs. "My friends and me" vs. "Me and my
friends"](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1133/my-friends-and-i-vs-my-friends-and-me-vs-me-and-my-friends)**
look no further than the Stack Exchange site [English Language &
Usage](http://english.stackexchange.com/). 

Stack Exchange is a collection of
question and answer sites, with topics that range from [Server
Fault](http://serverfault.com/)(server administration) to [Movies &
TV](http://movies.stackexchange.com/) to [Gardening &
Landscaping](http://gardening.stackexchange.com/).
