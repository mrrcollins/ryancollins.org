As I am working on our district's 1:1 plan, I have come across several quotes about progress that I liked (in no particular order):

"If There Is No Struggle, There Is No Progress" -- Frederick Douglass

"Don't be pushed by your problems. Be led by your dreams." -- Ralph Waldo Emerson

"There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still." -- Franklin D. Roosevelt

"Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything." -- George Bernard Shaw

"Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible." -- Frank Zappa

"Never confuse movement with action." -- Ernest Hemingway

"Those who do not move, do not notice their chains." -- Rosa Luxemburg
