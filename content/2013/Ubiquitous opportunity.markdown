[How To Use Real-Time Technology In 1:1 Classrooms](http://www.edudemic.com/real-time-technology-in-11-classrooms/)

>A concern about 1:1 programs I sometimes hear (and that I once held myself) was that students will always be “plugged in” and connected to a device. What seems to be happening on 6 Lime, though, is not ubiquitous use of devices. Instead, it is ubiquitous opportunity. Each teacher on this team has the option to make the best instructional choices each day, each class period. Each student on this team has opportunity for choice in his or her learning activity, growing awareness and taking greater responsibility.

I love that term, *ubiquitous opportunity*!
