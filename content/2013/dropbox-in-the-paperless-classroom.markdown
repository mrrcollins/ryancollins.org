[Dropbox Organization Tips for Teachers and the Paperless Classroom](http://www.coolcatteacher.com/dropbox-organization-teachers/)

>Dropbox is an essential for me. I like apps that link with Dropbox in every way and it is an essential part of my paperless routine with my students. This past Sunday at #txeduchat I was asked some specific questions about how I use Dropbox to take my classroom as paperless as possible, so I thought Iâ€™d make it my app of the week and teach you some things that might be helpful.

And if you are a Google Apps for Education school, most of these tips can apply directly to Google Drive.
