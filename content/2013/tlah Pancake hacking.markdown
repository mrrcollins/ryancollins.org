Last night we stayed at a Holiday Inn Express which offers a continental breakfast. My 9 year old daughter was fascinated with the automatic pancake maker.

Simple as can be, press **OK** and less than a minute later a pancake pops out. I was curious. What if I wanted more than one? As the maker worked its magic, I noticed it said *Making pancake 01 of 01*. Ok, so it must be possible. 

Examining the front of the device made it apparent that the aluminum was covering up something. After I waited for the Holiday Inn Express employee to leave, I pulled on the cover, revealing a control panel with a number pad. I hit **3** and **OK** and the pancake maker came to life, working on pancake **01 of 03**. Very cool. The 9 year old was, in her words, a little impressed.
