[A School's iPad Initiative Brings Optimism And Skepticism](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/10/25/240731070/a-schools-ipad-initiative-brings-optimism-and-skepticism)

>One of California's poorest school districts, the Coachella Valley Unified southeast of Los Angeles, is currently rolling out iPads to every student, pre-kindergarten through high school. It's an ambitious effort that administrators and parents hope will transform how kids learn, boost achievement and narrow the digital divide with wealthier districts.

>But, as with tablet efforts across the country, this one faces skeptics and obstacles. Some wonder if its projected benefits are being grossly oversold. 

Everytime I read one of these articles, the emphasis seems to dwell on the device. It's as if there exists the perfect device and every district that picks something different is doing it wrong.

Concentrate on what you can do with what you have. The best camera is the one you have with you, just like it is with you and your students.
