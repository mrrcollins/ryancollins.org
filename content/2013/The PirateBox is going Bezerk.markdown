My PirateBox was basically the [MK802 Android mini PC](http://www.amazon.com/MK802-Android-Google-Player-Allwinner/dp/B008BFXOZE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1370548870&sr=8-1&keywords=mk802) with the top part of the case removed. This was to allow better wifi reception. Since I'll be taking the PirateBox to Cedar Point, I thought I better make it a little be more secure. I stuffed the guts into an Atari 2600 Bezerk cartridge (don't worry, this was a spare so I can still play Bezerk. I also kept the inside of the cartridge so I can even play this on if I want).
