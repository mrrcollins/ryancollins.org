[Typists who clear 70 wpm can’t even say where the keys are](http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/12/typists-who-clear-70wpm-cant-even-say-where-the-keys-are/)

>The majority of typists couldn’t tell you how they type if they tried, according to a study published in October in the scientific journal Attention, Perception, and Pschyophysics. The finding comes from a body of typists who averaged 72 words per minute but could not map more than an average of 15 keys on a QWERTY keyboard.

I know I don't think about where the keys are, I just type. Anytime I take a
typing test, if they don't use words and just random letters I do worse.
