[Dictionary of Numbers](http://www.dictionaryofnumbers.com/) is a neat extension for Google's Chrome browser that gives you examples of large numbers in terms that could be easier to visualize. For example, 100M by itself might not mean much, but as the height of the Statue of Liberty it has more meaning.
