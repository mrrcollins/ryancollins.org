Now that [I've switched from Wordpress to Pelican](http://ryancollins.org/2013/05/06/good-bye-wordpress-hello-pelican/) I'm face with the dilemma on how to update Twitter and Facebook when I post to my blog. In Wordpress I used the [Social Plugin by MailChimp](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/social/) to automatically post, but plugins are not an option with a static website. 

But as I was working on a recipe in [If This Then That - IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) this morning it hit me, I can use IFTTT to automatically post a link to my new blog posts in Twitter and Facebook. To create the recipe:

1. Create an If This Then That account at [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).
2. Click **Channels** and add your Twitter account and Facebook page (or your Facebook account, depending on how you use Facebook).
3. Click **Create**
4. Use an **RSS Feed** for *This* and your Twitter account or Facebook account (or page) for *That*.
