=====================================================================

Jeremy Kaiser writes about [5 technology skills every student needs
before they leave high school](http://web20edu.com/2011/05/24/5-technology-skills-every-student-needs-before-they-leave-high-school/). Technology moves fast, but even this

[Why AppleTV & iPad beats Interactive Whiteboard?.every time](http://ryanorilio.wordpress.com/2013/01/20/why-appletv-an-ipad-beats-a-smartboard-everytime/). Pretty
much sums up my thoughts on the subject. :-) Along the same lines is an
article from Information Week on [Why Tablets Will Kill Smart Boards In
Classrooms](http://www.informationweek.com/why-tablets-will-kill-smart-boards-in-cl/240145886).

DAY-O
=====

![](http://dl.ryancollins.org/day-o.png)Running OS X and want to make that menu clock more useful? Check
out [Day-O](http://shauninman.com/archive/2011/10/20/day_o_mac_menu_bar_clock). It replaces the menu bar clock that still shows the date
and time, but when you click on it, Day-O gives you a monthly calendar.
Quite handy when you want to look for a date quickly.
