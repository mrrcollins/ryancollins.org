Interruptions are deadly. Well, maybe that's a little bit of exaggeration. But even [three second interruptions can cause problems](http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2013/brief-interruptions-spawn-errors/). I've decided to take back the notifications on my phone.

First stop was the phone ringer. Apple doesn't have a silent ringtone on the iPhone, so I had to search. In my searching I came across the article [iPhone tip: Use a Silent Ringtone to Screen Calls in Your Sleep](http://richardkmiller.com/702/iphone-tip-use-a-silent-ringtone-to-screen-calls-in-your-sleep). It not only contained the silent ringtone but also directions on using it. My default ringtone is silence, and a different ringtone is set for those people for which my phone should always right.

Next up was text alerts. The iPhone has a silent text alert, so that part was easier than the ringtone. Then I also went in and added a tone for just a few people.

Finally, I went into Settings -> Notifications and turned off the sound notifications for most of my applications. 

Now I have a nice, mostly silent phone which [doesn't interrupt me](http://ryancollins.org/2013/08/27/dont-interrupt-me/).
