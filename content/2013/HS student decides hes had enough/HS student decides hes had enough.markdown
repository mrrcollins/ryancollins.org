I'm not sure how to take this rant of Jeff Bliss, high school student:

On one hand, this is obviously a student that values his education and is tired of doing worksheets. Could he have handled it better? Probably. In the follow up video it shows that he is thirsty for knowledge and wants something better for his life:

It will be interesting to see how the school deals with the situation. What other ways could the student have expressed himself?
