[Google Releases qCraft Mod For Minecraft So Kids Can Explore Quantum Computing](http://hothardware.com/News/Google-Releases-qCraft-Mod-For-Minecraft-So-Kids-Can-Explore-Quantum-Computing/)

>Google recognizes the potential here well, and wanted to add quantum physics into the mix. Thus, the 'qCraft' mod was born, one that adds new blocks that add an entirely new mechanic to the game, such as quantum entanglement, superposition, and observer dependency.

>The company admits that this isn't a "perfect scientific simulation", but there's such thing as "good enough" here. The goal is to get kids and others interested in quantum physics, and judging from a quick demo, it looks to have major potential.

Very cool!
