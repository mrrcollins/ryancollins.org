[Why Is the Research on Learning Styles Still Being Dismissed by Some Learning Leaders and Practitioners?](http://elearnmag.acm.org/featured.cfm?aid=2070611)

>I have been battling the notion of "designing instruction for learning styles" in my own quixotic fashion for a couple of decades now. In my attempt to be a good steward of my clients' shareholders' equity I wished to help them avoid faddish instructional design practices that have been disproven by empirical research. I first learned back in the 1980s at NSPI (now ISPI) conferences that while self-reported learning style preferences do exist, that designing instruction to accommodate them has no basis.

Wow, research dates back 30 years yet we still hear about accommodating the different learning styles.
