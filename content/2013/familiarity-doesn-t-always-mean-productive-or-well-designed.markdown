[Clinging to Outlook, Only 25% of Employees Willing to Use Yahoo Mail](http://allthingsd.com/20131124/while-users-lament-only-25-percent-of-yahoos-willing-eat-mail-dogfood-memo/)

>At this point in your life, Outlook may be familiar, which we can often confuse with productive or well designed.

How many times have you been faced with a change in software or hardware, and
just wish you can go back to the old way? 

The next sentence is just all sorts of awesome:

>Certainly, we can admire the application for its survival, an anachronism of
>the now defunct 90s PC era, a pre-web program written at a time when NT Server
>terrorized the data center landscape with the confidence of a T-Rex born to
>yuppie dinosaur parents who fully bought into the illusion of their son’s utter
>uniqueness because the big-mouthed, tiny-armed monster infant could mimic the
>gestures of The Itsy-Bitsy Pterodactyl. There was a similar outcry when we
>moved away from Outlook’s suite-mates in the Microsoft Office dreadnaught. But
>whether it’s familiarity, laziness or simple stubbornness dressed in a cloak of
>Ayn Randian Objectivism, the time has come to move on, commrade.

Wow.
