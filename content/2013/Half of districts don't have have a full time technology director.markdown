[Many Districts Go Without a Chief Tech Officer](http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2013/10/08/7465849.htm)

>Even as schools juggle a daunting array of evolving technological demands, federal data show that roughly half of districts do not have a full-time chief technology officer or technology manager whose sole job is to oversee all digital needs. Those needs include ensuring that technology contributes to improved classroom instruction, as well as making sure it works properly.

I applaud those districts that are able to make it work without a technology coordinator.
