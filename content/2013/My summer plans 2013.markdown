I'm not going to let a little thing like summer already being 3 weeks in the past to stop me from making a few goals on what I want to do this summer. :-) And since I'm more likely to accomplish things if I write them down, I decided to post them here for all to see and to also keep me on track.

1. Read three novels: *The Great Gatsby*, *Catching Fire*, and *To Kill a Mockingbird*. I usually get so caught up with non-fiction (including all my RSS feeds) that I don't read as much fiction as I should. There really isn't any particular reason for reading these, except for the fact that two of them have movies in 2013.
2. Write an interactive fiction game in Inform 7. Interactive fiction may be somewhat of a dead genre but I think it's a fascinating way to create a story. I bought [Creating Interactive Fiction with Inform 7 by Aaron Reed](http://www.amazon.com/Creating-Interactive-Fiction-Inform-7/dp/1435455061) in September of 2010. I think it's about time to put it to use!
3. Create a [Little Free Library](http://www.littlefreelibrary.org/). These are the book equivalent of take a penny/leave a penny.
4. Finish my super secret web tool.... :-)

Is there anything you're doing this summer?
