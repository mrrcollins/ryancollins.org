Do you have a iOS device that doesn't have Siri? Are you feeling lonely and would like to talk to your device? Maybe [Google Search](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-search/id284815942?mt=8) is what you need. 

Once you install it, you can ask Google questions, like "Is it going to rain tonight?" or "What time do the buckeyes play today?". It's not all the automation that Siri does, but it's pretty nice.

([Google Chrome](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chrome/id535886823?mt=8) also supports dictation in the app)
