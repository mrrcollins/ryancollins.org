[The Incredible Story Of Marion Stokes, Who Single-Handedly Taped 35 Years Of TV
News](http://www.fastcompany.com/3022022/the-incredible-story-of-marion-stokes-who-single-handedly-taped-35-years-of-tv-news?nid=3022022)

>In a storage unit somewhere in Philadelphia, 140,000 VHS tapes sit packed into four shipping containers. Most are hand-labeled with a date between 1977 and 2012, and if you pop one into a VCR you might see scenes from the Iranian Hostage Crisis, the Reagan Administration, or Hurricane Katrina.

>It's 35 years of history through the lens of TV news, captured on a dwindling format.

I would love to see the archives in December from the 70s and 80s, just for the
commercials.
