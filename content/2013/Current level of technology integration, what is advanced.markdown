Tonight on #OETchat the first question was:

>Q1: What do you believe is the current level or state of technology integration in schools & how effective is it? #OETchat

I answered that most were beginners, and some were intermediate. Then I said that none were advanced. Do you know of any districts or schools in Ohio that are advanced with technology integration? Responding to comments I started to try to picture what advanced means. I guess at the basic level advanced means that students are creating more than consuming. Creating in this sense means more than just using an office suite. 

What are other aspects of advanced? Maker spaces? Coding? Digital publishing and story telling? What else?
