[Nix the Tricks](http://www.nixthetricks.com/)

>We are committed teachers who want to take the magic out of mathematics and focus on the beauty of sense-making. We wish for teachers everywhere to seek coherence and connection rather than offer students memorized procedures and short-cutting tricks. Students are capable of rich conceptual understanding; don't rob them of the opportunity to experience the discovery of new concepts. 

It's a [free eBook](http://www.nixthetricks.com/Download.html) about the math
tricks that masquerade as teaching concepts. I have mixed feelings, it seems
like I use a lot of tricks. But at the same time, I do understand the concepts
and why the trick works. Maybe that's the difference?
