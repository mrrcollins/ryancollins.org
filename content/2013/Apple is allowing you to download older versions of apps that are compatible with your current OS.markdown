Over at [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1mjw36/people_with_old_ios_devices_you_can_now_install/) there is a screenshot that shows Apple giving the users of older devices the ability to install the last compatible version of an app for their current OS.

Hopefully this will continue, it's very frustrating on my original iPod touch to not be able to find any apps that install on iOS 3.1.3.
