[The IT Value Hierarchy: Using Maslowâ€™s Hierarchy of Needs as a Metaphor for Gauging the Maturity Level of Information Technology Use within Competitive Organizations](http://site.xavier.edu/crable/IT_Value_Maslow.pdf)(PDF)

>Although information technology products and services may be equally available, the innovative use of IT to create competitive differentiation has clearly been achieved y many organizations. What IT executives often lack is a contextual framework in which to explain the path to increasing value for their firms. The authors believe that this framework can be explained through the use of a needs hierarchy based on a comparison to the human psychological needs hierarchy described by Abraham Maslow more than sixty years ago.

The parallels to technology in education is uncanny. This paper provides a nice framework for the technology planning process. Just replace **IT executives** with **staff, administration, BOE, and community**. :-)
