# Is subversion the only way?

[Doug Johnson](http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/blue-skunk-blog/2013/6/6/is-subversion-the-only-way.html) writes about the decisions one must make when deciding what to do when your vision doesn't align with your organization's goals.

# Writing vs Speaking

[John August](http://johnaugust.com/2013/writing-vs-speaking) brings us a TED talk by [John McWhorter](http://youtu.be/UmvOgW6iV2s) titled **Txtng is killing language. JK!!!**. Mr. August discusses the various differences between writing, speaking, and elaborates on Mr. McWhorter's take on texting.
