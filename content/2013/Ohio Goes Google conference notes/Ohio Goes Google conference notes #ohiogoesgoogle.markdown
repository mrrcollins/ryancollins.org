On Tuesday I had the pleasure of attending my first [Ohio Goes Google Conference](http://www.itipohio.org/OhioGoogleAppsConference.aspx) presented by [ITIP Ohio](http://www.itipohio.org/). The sessions I attended were very informative, I picked up quite a few different tips and ideas. (**I'll emphasize my thoughts like this.**)

# Keynote speaker - Jennie Magiera @msmagiera

## Google Moderator

**The Google Tool that nobody uses was big. Jennie Magiera talked it up, and then Sean Beavers led a session at lunch on it. Google Moderator allows for classroom participation in which the participants can post ideas and vote on these ideas.**

# Using Google Scripts to Automate Your Life - Jennifer Magiera

* Doctopus
* Goobric (Doctopus extension)
* FormMule (Calendar merge)

**I had not used FormMule before, looks like it could be very handy. Especially for dealing with input into Google Forms.**

## Resources

* [Chrome Web Store - Lazarus: Form Recovery](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lazarus-form-recovery/loljledaigphbcpfhfmgopdkppkifgno?hl=en-US&utm_source=chrome-ntp-launcher)

**A must have Google Chrome Extension!**


# Changing Google from Bland to Beautiful -  Eric Griffith

* Use Google Drawings
* Object based, objects can be linkable
* Use the built in Web Clipboard to copy/paste multiple shapes
* openclipart.org
* softicons.com
* Drag and drop between tabs in Chrome
* Presentation will be available on YouTube through the  Ohio Goes Google web page

**This was a very cool session. A lot of complaints I hear about Google Docs is that fact that it's hard to lay things out in the document. By use Google Drawing objects, you can add pizzazz to those boring Google Docs documents.**
