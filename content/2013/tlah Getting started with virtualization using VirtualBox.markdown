Do you want to check out Linux on your current machine safely, leaving your current set up untouched? Virtualization allows you to do this using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). We are investigating this method to [integrate BYOD with our 1 to 1 program](http://ryancollins.org/2013/08/28/solve-byod-consistency-issues-with-virtualbox/). Wikihow has a nice [write up on how to install Ubuntu on VirtualBox](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox). Keep in mind that you want to have at least 2GB of memory (4 would be better) and 10-20GB of disk space free. 

Once you have it set up, play around with Ubuntu and see what all the fuss is about!
