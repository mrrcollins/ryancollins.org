[Technology Will Not Replace Teachers](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-dunn/teachers-technology_b_4130200.html)

>As much innovation as the iPad may bring to the classroom, it's not going to replace a teacher anytime soon. In fact, the influx of technology like iPads means there is a greater need for teachers. We need teachers who are part early adopter, part integrator, and part mad scientist. The modern teacher must be willing to take chances and able to figure out how not just how technology works, but how it works for each student, and where its use is most appropriate.

Mad scientist indeed!
