[Harrison Ford "Han Solo" DL-44 Blaster from Star Wars](http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/harrison-ford-han-solo-dl-44-blaster-from-star-379-c-44e307f3bc)

>Particularly noteworthy scenes requiring this lighter version are when Darth
>Vader uses the Force to lasso the blaster out of Han’s hand in Empire, and in
>Jedi when Han wrestles with a Stormtrooper to regain possession of his blaster
>during the Rebels’ encounter with Imperial forces on Endor.

This would be awesome!
