# In Pursuit of Happiness

First up is an impassioned teacher's resignation video. Her speech won't be a revelation for teachers. I'm posting it for those out there who feel the same way, **You're not alone**.

One fascinating aspect of watching this on Youtube is the number of *I quite* videos from other teachers listed in the **What's related** section.

# Embrace the box

[Stephen Ransom shares a TED video](http://ransomtech.edublogs.org/2013/05/29/embrace-the-box/) in which he reflects on how teachers use limitations as a reason not to do something.

# Font Awesome

This font came up on [Twitter from RichLewis007](https://twitter.com/RichLewis007/status/341935394746667010). It's a font like Wingdings, but with icons like you see in apps and on websites. It would make a great addition to your computer, especially if you are creating help sheets for students or teachers.
