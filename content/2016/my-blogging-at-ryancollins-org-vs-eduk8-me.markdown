I've been struggling with my online identity and what I want to share. Too often I try to spread myself too thin, but if I'm not trying to learn it all I feel like I'm missing something. If you haven't noticed, I've taken a different route with [RyanCollins.org](http://ryancollins.org) and [Eduk8.me](http://eduk8.me). For now I'm going to use [RyanCollins.org](http://ryancollins.org) for more nerdy pastimes, such as [Raspberry Pi hacking](http://ryancollins.org/2016/01/27/set-your-raspberry-pi-up-for-wifi-roaming/) and [command line tomfoolery](http://ryancollins.org/2016/01/15/using-rss-like-its-1990/), and [Eduk8.me](http://eduk8.me) for more general purpose Edtech tips.
