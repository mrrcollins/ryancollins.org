My Pi is doing a pretty good job on connecting to wifi when I travel between places. Unfortunately, my autossh job on the Pi is not working. 

I set up autossh to open up a reverse ssh tunnel to a known host, allowing me to always ssh to my Pi using a hostname. But it seems like I need to do some more testing.
