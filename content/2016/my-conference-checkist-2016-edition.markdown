As I get ready for the Ohio Educational Technology Conference this week I though it would be a good idea to [revisit my conference checklist](http://ryancollins.org/2014/05/02/attending-a-conference-heres-my-conference-checklist-ipadsymposiumua/). 

## 1. Charge devices and battery packs

My devices I'm currently taking are a 2010 MacBook Pro, iPad Mini 3, and iPhone 6 Plus. I'd like to take my Kindle and a Raspberry Pi, but I get tired of lugging a 30 lb backpack around for three days. My current USB battery pack of choice is the [PowerGen 12000mAh External Battery](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0085OB0IE?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage) (unfortunately, it looks like it is now unavailable). The nice thing about this battery pack is that it supports pass through charging, which means I can power a Raspberry Pi and plug it in to charge without disrupting the Pi. 

During the conference I'll rely on my iPad Mini or iPhone a majority of the time. Even though [I now get almost 7 hours of battery life out of my MacBook Pro](http://eduk8.me/2016/01/running-a-mac-on-battery-youll-probably-want-to-switch-to-safari/), that's still not enough to get through three days of a conference.

## 2. Set up IFTTT to capture my notes and tweets

If This Then That (IFTTT) is a web service that can interact with services and do things on your behalf. To facilitate my note taking during conferences, I set up IFTTT to automatically append all of my tweets with the conference hashtag to a file. With this set up, I can share what I learn in the sessions and automatically save them to my notes.

## 3. Set up a keyboard shortcut for the conference hashtag

And, to make it easier to use the conference hashtag, I will use the iPhone keyboard shortcuts and set **ooo** to be the conference hashtag **#oetc16**. I'll also have **oxx** set for the OETCx unconference hashtag **#oetcx**.

## 4. Add a workflow to Drafts for tweeting during the conference

Drafts for iOS is my go to app for creating notes and automating tasks on my iPhone. For conferences, I'll set up a workflow that will tweet the draft with the conference hashtags. With this set up, I click Drafts, type my tweet, and then run the conference tweeting workflow which will append the conference hashtag to the Tweet and then send it. Pretty nifty.

## 5. Get gas, cash, and Ho Hos

The Ho Hos should not need an explanation.
