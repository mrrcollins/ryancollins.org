I was thinking about my [blog post from last week][], contemplating on
how I should be more positive. People using technology in schools are
already facing enough of an uphill battle without me picking on them.
:-)

Stealing [Alvin's Efficiency Tips][] idea, I want to post little tips,
tricks, ideas to help the technology support staff in the education
sector. Some of my ideas may seem to be esoteric (such as learning vi),
but others should have more common appeal (imaging machings). There are
conversations that happen on the Technology Coordinator's listserv that
also need to be condensed and posted.

Does this seem like a good idea? What about also creating handout sheets
to help with professional development?
