I picked up an iPod Touch on Saturday, and am I impressed. I have been
testing out the Nokia N800, but when it comes to Internet usability, the
Touch wins hands down. Surfing is very, very usable.

I'm still getting used to the onscreen keyboard, but it is already a lot
better than the N800. The question I have remaining, "Is the touch more
useful I'm the classroom than the Asus eeePC?
