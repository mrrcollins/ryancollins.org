[Placeopedia.com][] allows users to connect Wikipedia entries with their
geographical location. What a great way to see what landmarks/historical
entries are located near your home town. It allows anyone one to place
entries on the map, so if your area is blank you can search Wikipedia
for local landmarks and place them on the map yourself. And if the local
landmarks are not in Wikipedia, it would be a great start for your
students to research, edit, and then publish their entry on the landmark
in Wikipedia.
