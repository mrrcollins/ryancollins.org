The Senior Experience  
- class

What  
- 21st century teaching and learning  
- language arts credit  
- students apply, 6 students in class  
- blog about their senior year.  
- Also go to the other buildings  
- They get a MacBook  
- Digital camera this year  
- Taught to be responsible with social media  
- Real life experience. Work in the administration offices during class
period

Student videos

The project is the 4 Cs.

Why did we need the senior experience?  
- additional help  
- Social media experience  
- Main Street Madison - parent lead public forum. People were visiting
it for information instead of going to the school's website.

The plan:  
- First year the students were hand picked for the pilot.  
- Wanted it to be part of the main website  
- want video and pictures in the blog  
- promoting the seniors  
- highlight videos

How is it evaluated  
- Students are earning language arts credit  
- students still have to take senior English  
- problem based learning  
- website hits  
- a lot less misconceptions posted on main street Madison  
- track top pages on site, blogs are consistently in the top 10

People do want to hear about the academics

Risks  
- safety: signed aup, contract, loan agreement for equipment,  
- Money: permanent improvement funds,  
- Responsibility: AJ Huff

Q: did you have to turn people away the 2nd year?  
A: received a list of 40 recommendations from the English dept.
Widdowed it down to 20, then discussed with the principal. 12 were asked
to apply, of which 10 did.

Q: comments are blocked on the blogs, what about the FB page?  
A: FB page is new, but hopefully can turn negative comments to
positive.

Q: Any plans to open it to others?  
A: not at this time

Q: How did you come up with 6?  
A: Original plan was they would be paired, because they work
unsupervised in the office.

Q: How will you use Facebook?  
A: Ultimate goal is to still drive traffic back to the website.

Q: How often do the students post?  
A: In the beginning they tried 1 to 2 times a week, but that became an
issue with all the other projects. Now it's around once every 7-10 days.

Q: How do you handle their personal FB pages?  
A: That's really outside of the jurisdiction of the school.

Q: How much do you change their articles?  
A: Quick edits, try not to change the message. Did have a problem with
one post, student talked about the whole family going to Florida for
spring break.

Q: Controversal issues in the school?  
A: Situation hasn't come up
