[![The audience \#4][]][]At the eTech Ohio Technology Conference this
past February I presented on different ways a person can communicate.
Some ways were very low tech (writing a letter, using the phone), and
some ways very high tech (using Grand Central to control incoming calls,
social networking with del.icio.us or Twitter). I've finally gotten
around to tagging the sites in [del.icio.us][] (thanks [Alvin][]!). I
used the tag [etechohio08][].
