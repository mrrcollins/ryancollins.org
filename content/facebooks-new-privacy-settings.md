Facebook has begun rolling out new settings for who can see your
Facebook profile and what they can see on your profile. I suggest you
double-check what is viewable about you. I try to keep my personal FB
totally separate from my [Facebook Page][], so my profile is pretty much
locked down. Over at [Digital Inspiration][] they've written an article
onÂ [How to Cross-Check Your Facebook Privacy Settings][].
