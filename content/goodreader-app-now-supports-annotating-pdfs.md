The latest update to the best \$.99 I've ever spent on an all for my
iPad just made the application even better. Goodreader now allows you to
mark up PDFs, adding notes, highlighting text, or drawing. It can save
the markup in the same file or make a copy for you, preserving the
original.

If you have \$1 and an iPad, this app is well worth it.
