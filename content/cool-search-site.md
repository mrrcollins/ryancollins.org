We've all come to love and rely on [Google][], but I was alerted to a
new site today, [Clusty][]. This search engine takes your search query,
and "clusters" the results into different search topics. For example, I
did a search on ["volcano"][], and not only did it give me a list of
websites for volcanoes, it gave me some categories to help me refine my
search. These categories included:  
?Hawaii (36)  
?Volcano Observatory (20)  
?Volcano information (16)  
?Geological, Survey (12)  
?Earth (16)  
?Movie, Review (16)  
?Kids (15)  
?Flows (11)  
?Mount St. Helens (9)  
?Safety, Images

I could then click on any of those to see URLs in that category. Try it
out at [http://clusty.com/][Clusty].
