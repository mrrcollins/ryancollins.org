[EduCon 2.5][] took place this past weekend in Philadelphia. I was
extremely lucky and grateful for a chance to attend last year, and
attend isn't quite the right word to use. A better word would be
*experience*.

> What is EduCon?  
>  EduCon is both a conversation and a conference.
>
> It is an innovation conference where we can come together, both in
> person and virtually, to discuss the future of schools. Every session
> will be an opportunity to discuss and debate ideas â€” from the very
> practical to the big dreams.

Videos of Educon sessions
-------------------------

[All of the sessions are available to watch on Youtube!][]. Try not to
be overwhelmed by the number of videos, just take one a day/week/month.
A great resource for an edchat in your school district and a glimpse
into how learning takes place in other schools.

Why Preaching to the \#educhoir Really DOES Matter
--------------------------------------------------

I've written about the [echo chamber][] before and the perils therein,
but Bill Ferriter writes how sometimes [you need the echo chamber][].
