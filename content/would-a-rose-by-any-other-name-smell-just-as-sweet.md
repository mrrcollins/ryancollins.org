Fascinating research. They even examined twin girls and found that what
they were named could put them on two entirely different career paths.
Also, naming a child with a 'lower-status' name, spelled in an unusual
way or including punctuation, lowered exam scores by 3-5%.

One more thing for new parents to worry about. :-)
