patent claims:

This is good news, especially not only for Desire2Learn, but also users
of all online coursework delivery systems. Although I'm torn on the idea
of software patents, the ones awarded to Blackboard in my opinion did
not pass the obviousness test. Blackboard has gone on record that they
were not going to go after open source implementations like Moodle, but
I can't help to think that just the idea that Blackboard could sue would
put a damper on some new Moodle installations.
