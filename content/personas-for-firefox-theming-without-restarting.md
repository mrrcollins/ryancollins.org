When we first started recommending Firefox, one of the first features
that the students found was the ability to change themes. Unfortunately,
changing a theme is a pretty heavy weight process, requiring a restart
of Firefox. Mozilla Labs has been working on a different theming
process, [Personas][], which doesn't require a restart:

> **Features**
>
> -   You can select a Persona from the dynamic menus and see results
>     instantly without having to discover, select, download or install
>     a separate bit of software or code.
> -   Personas can be added, removed or updated by their designers at
>     any time, without requiring a software update.

One caveat, the theme can be changed by the designer at anytime, which
means there is a chance that something inappropriate may be viewed.
