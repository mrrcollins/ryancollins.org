One common question I see asked all the time is whether or not teachers
should friend students on Facebook. Although you can set your privacy
settings on Facebook to hide certain aspects of your life from groups of
friends, this isn't fool proof. Friending everyone including students
and parents simply begins breaking down yet another wall between your
professional life and personal life.

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">
What you can do is create a Facebook Page for yourself. This gives you a
presence on Facebook that can be used professionally which is totally
separated from your person life.

"A Facebook Page is a public profile that enables you to share your
business and products with Facebook users. Create one in a few minutes
with our simple interface."

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">
Unfortunately, your created page has a very unwieldy url. Mine is
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ryan-Collins/181385642299. What I've done
is setup a redirect from my website to point ryancollins.org/facebook to
my Facebook Page. Be sure to become a friend when you visit! :-)

Facebook Pages are not limited to people either, you could also create a
Page for each class you teacher or other departments within your
organization.
