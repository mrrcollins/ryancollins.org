For Kenton City Schools our original domain name was the standard
[kenton.k12.oh.us][]. Unfortunately, only techies could remember it
correctly, so I registered [kentoncityschools.org][kenton.k12.oh.us].
I'm still kicking myself for not registering the .com version, it's
since been picked up by domain squatter. :-( Kentoncityschools.org has
served us well, even with it being longer than our original k12.oh.us
version.

In the back of my head I had always wanted a shorter domain, and with
more and more mobile technologies being put into use, it only made sense
to try to find a shorter domain name that we could use to supplement our
current two. Trying to find a shorter .com/.net/.org was futile, so I
started looking at alternative top level domain names, and settled on
[kcs.me][]. Now you can go to [http://kcs.me/][kcs.me] and it will
automatically redirect to our main page. I haven't started integrating
it into to many other services, but I do plan on setting up our email
accounts so you can use @kcs.me for any current address and it will
work. We also have a custom 404 error page that let's us setup keywords
as shortcuts to commonly used web pages on our website, such as the
user's personal portal page (their MyCatPage, [kcs.me/my][]) and staff
home pages ([kcs.me/collinsr][]).

For your school or business, have you thought about additional domains
or am I just being weird?
