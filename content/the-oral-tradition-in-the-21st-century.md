> [The Our Stories™ project][] helps people share the stories of their
> lives, no matter where they live or how their stories unfold. We're
> providing resources to create and share personal stories from all over
> the world, starting with children in developing countries who are
> using One Laptop per Child (OLPC) computers or those who are working
> with UNICEF radio producers to record and share interviews. Children
> are asked to record the stories of elders, family members, and
> friends.
