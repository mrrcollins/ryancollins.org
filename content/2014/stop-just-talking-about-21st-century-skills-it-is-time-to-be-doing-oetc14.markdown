My random notes from [Stop just talking about 21st century skills, it is time to be doing](http://https://docs.google.com/document/d/19QSiRDYwI1vktgcr6jxaZKzgLGte1saCMFEc_LlLxEI/edit).

* [Presentation](http://https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DLAry2ZCaFY0BHQH0auKwrPjIwxlcXtPFHjaZv9quyY/edit#slide=id.p)
* Ditch the “turn in the assignment product & get a final grade” model and move to a “continuous collaborative, editing, improving process” model.
* It’s not cheating it’s collaboration; almost everywhere, except schools, will expect them to work with others- to solve problems, brainstorm, create opportunities, edit & proofread, share and instruct & learn from one another.
* Tons of links for using search engines and teaching how to search.
    * Use the first search to find keywords that will help you narrow
      your search
    * Use control (command on Macs) F to search for words on a page.
* Media literacy - Evaluate sources
* [SearchFindKnow.com](http://searchfindknow.com)
* Moving toward flipping/blending/hybrid class. 
* Teach above your head
    * You you feel you are completely comfortable and in control, you
      are preparing your students for your past and not their future.
    * Go outside your comfort zone
    * Independent study with Arduinos
    * Self directed learning
