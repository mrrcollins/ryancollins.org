This Saturday I will be presenting at the University of Akron's iPad Symposium. As I've attended numerous conferences throughout my professional career, I've started to realize I should create a to do list so I don't forget anything before a conference.

# 1. Charge my devices and battery packs

My usual compliment of devices I take to a conference consists of my laptop, iPad, and iPhone. Along with charging them, I also have a battery case for my iPhone and a Jackery Giant USB battery pack that needs to be charged. Multi-day conferences are not a problem.

# 2. Set up IFTTT to capture my notes and tweets

I've started to use Twitter to write my notes during a conference and  [If This Then That](http://ifttt.com) to capture them. The recipe I use looks for any of my tweets with the conference hashtag, and if found, it appends that tweet to a text file in [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com). At the end of the conference I'll have an entire text file with everything I want to save from the conference.

# 3. Set up a keyboard shortcut for the conference hashtag

The hashtag for the conference Saturday is #iPadSymposiumUA. What I did on my iPhone and iPad is create a keyboard shortcut (Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts). The shortcut is **iii** which expands to #iPadSymposiumUA.

# 4. Charge my name tag

The name tag I've started to use is a 4 generation iPod Touch running Keynote. I have a lanyard that connects to the dock connector, and I created a 3 slide presentation that continually loops. Keynote keeps the display on while showing a presentation. If I shut it off during sessions, the battery lasts an entire day.

# 5. Gas up the car, get some cash and Ho Hos

Oh, how frustrating it can be to get in your car for a multi-hour trip and realize you have to stop for gas. Even though I hardly use cash anymore, it's a good idea to have a few bucks on you, just in case. The Ho Hos? They're self explanatory.
