>It’s a sad commentary on the state of education in the U.S. when a move like this is praised.

>To say I’m disappointed that Google views education through such a narrow lens is an understatement. For a company that has been built on innovation to invest millions into a program that levels books, awards points for low-level knowledge and comprehension, and creates bad data is a travesty.

>And you call this personalized learning? What’s personalized about letting a computer system match kids with books?

>You’re missing the point about what reading instruction should be, and you are helping to systematically destroy the joy in books.
