I don't know why I've never heard of this before, [Kingsoft Office Suite: Free Office 2013, Professional Office Suite](http://www.kingsoftstore.com/) looks like it could be very handy for schools running Windows, but that isn't even the best part. The requirements listed on the website show that it supports iOS 5, which means all of those iPad 1s that are out there can use it. Unfortunately, the App Store lists iOS 6 as an requirement, so I'm going to have to wait until I get home to try it.
