width=200 align=right>On Wednesday I had the distinct pleasure of
attending Beaver Local's professional development waiver day. It was a
twofer for me, I not only got a chance to see how they ran their waiver
day PD, but I also had the
chance to present and converse with the staff in the district. This was
invaluable to me, and I was very appreciative to have the chance to
attend.

Since the Ohio eTech Conference I've been trying to screencast everytime
I teach or present. Here are the 5 presentions from Wednesday:

* [Teach Like a Hacker session 1](http://cdn.ryancollins.org/movies/2014/tlah01.mp4)
