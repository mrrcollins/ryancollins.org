Here is a list of links and sites I have collected from the Beaver
Local Teach Like a Pirate Waiver Day and the Learn 21 Conference. In the
near future I'm hoping to have time to elaborate on these resources and
how they may be used.

This is what the 21st century is all about. Students order their
yearbooks, but can also customize their yearbook with their own
