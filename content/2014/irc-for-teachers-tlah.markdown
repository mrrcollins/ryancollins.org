Since the website at [talk.eduk8.me](http://talk.eduk8.me) just isn't up to everyone's standards on using IRC for group chats I've put together a brief tutorial on installing a Chrome app that works a lot better than the website. It is also prettier. :-) (I also stumbled acrossed [Tiny Tiny IRC](http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-irc/wiki/) tonight, but the install is a little more involved, so this will be a later project.)

For this tutorial, you'll be using Google Chrome. There is a Chatzilla add on for Firefox, and if there is a demand, I'll put together a tutorial for Firefox users (although you'll probably be able to use this one to get started with Chatzilla). In Chrome, go to the Chrome Apps store and search for [CIRC](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/circ/bebigdkelppomhhjaaianniiifjbgocn?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) (or click the link). Install the app, and then launch it.

You'll be created with a nice chat box, but you're not connected to any servers yet. Before you connect to a server, you'll need to set a nickname. In the message box, type ```/nick NICKNAME``` where NICKNAME is the nickname you want to use.

Now you are ready to connect. In the message box, type ```/server talk.eduk8.me``` (If you haven't noticed, all of the IRC commands start with a slash (/)). CIRC will connect you to the server.

Once on the server, you need to connect to a room. Type ```/join #tlah``` to join the **Teach Like a Hacker**. Rooms are created and destroyed on the fly. If you join a room that doesn't exists, a room will be created. And as soon as the last person leaves a room, the room is destroyed.

Now that you're in the room, start typing! On the left you will see a list of members of the current room along with a list of connected servers and channels. Anything typed in the box that doesn't begin with a slash will be sent to everyone in the room.
