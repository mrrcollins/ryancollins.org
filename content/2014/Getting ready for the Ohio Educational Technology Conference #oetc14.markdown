My presentations are.... Well, let's say there are slides and an outline, but they will never be finished. I will be constantly tweaking until I present, and then I'll have presenters remorse afterwards of missed opportunities. :-)

Monday I will be presenting [Teach Like a Hacker](http://s19.a2zinc.net/clients/etechohio/OETC2014/Public/SessionDetails.aspx?FromPage=SpeakerList.aspx&SessionID=844) in room C213-C214 at 2:15. You too can hack, come! For those that can't attend, I'll be posting my slides tomorrow and the [chat room will be open](http://talk.eduk8.me/) the entire conference (chat room is also accessible over IRC, server is talk.eduk8.me, channel is #tlah). 

Tuesday is a big day with the ALTconference, OETCx. Come and watch the keynote with your fellow OETC participants. It's a different experience being able to hold conversations while watching the keynote. I'll be presenting an Ignite style FRED talk that afternoon which will be exciting since it involves Star Wars.
