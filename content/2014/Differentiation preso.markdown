* Usually used at the high school
* Equipment
    * iOS, PC, Mac, etc.
    * Microphone
    * Topic: script or keywords
    * Media
 * Options to record
      * Screencast-o-Mac
      * Jing
      * Screenr
      * EduCanon
      * Educreations
      * Teach by Knowmia
      * Camtasia ($)
      * Snag it ($)
   * Combining technology
       * Younger students, watch videos at school while teacher works with other students
       * different types of media: pictures, videos, PDFs, etc.
   * Put the video on an iPad, place the iPad at the back of the room
   * students create own screencasts
   * distribution
       * Twitter, shortened links, qr codes, LMS

# MS examples
* 8-12 min
* Paper and pencil only
* Put little secrets into the audio that the student needs to know so you can verify they watched.
* Help when students are absent
* Homework is not a grade; it's a behavior.
* Students lost lunch with their friends if they hadn't watched videos
* Be consistant
* Short 3-6 question formative assessment
* Put into one of three groups based on assessment: relearn, practice, enrich
* "I want to know what they know right now"
* Asked principal to co-teach by having all the students with IEPs in the grade level
* Or use centers
* Or team with another classroom

# Differentiated assessments
* same standards, different levels
* Every page is a different standard
* five levels of questions
* low: 1-3, middle: 2-4, high: 3-5
* "The definition of teaching is to ensure learning." Jim Connell
* Don't let students off the hook, 81% on a test means they don't know 19%
* students like to hear their own teacher's voice. Can be tailored to their needs
* Very good for students on IEPs, able to watch at their pace
* Good for parents

## What would I do different?
* embed video in Google form for easy formative assessment
* [Sophia - create lessons/tutorials](http://www.sophia.org)
* Complete Chrome lesson, get a free tshirt
* Flipped classroom and ipad certification available

## Pitfalls
* stick with it. There is a learning curve for everyone
* Create a system that works for you and your students when they don't do it

## Results
* Teachers have started at the high school
* satisfaction, doing the right thing every day
* more time in class to teach and troubleshoot
* Actually took less time
