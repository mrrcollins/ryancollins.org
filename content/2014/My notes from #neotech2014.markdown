# Creating 21st century assignments: autonomous, mas tery learning
* At the heart of everything is empathy. 
* Spends 1st ~4 weeks on building legacy, very little content. Build relationships.
* Students move at their own pace toward mastery through autonomy. "Change your philosophy first"
* "We strive to inspire, not motivate. What is your legacy?"
* [Presentation link](http://www.teachersfortomorrow.net/1/post/2014/03/neotech-2014.html)
* "The world you grew up in does not exist and will never again exist" - @ProfessorMike1 @GarthHolman
* Require a blog for students. They must publish.
* "Blogs aren't graded. Once you start grading creative writing, students write what they think you want to read."
* "Totally differentiated classroom everyday for every student."
* Team taught 30 miles away. Posted Skype conversations. 20% students in Chardon don't have Internet access.
* Sites to check out Diigo and Quizstar.
* "Teach kids how to differentiate for themselves. Technology makes it possible."
* Instagrok - search tool for students.
* "High school students share resources with 7th graders"
* "We're killing kids with worksheets. They're capable of so much more." 

# Tech skills 4 the next generation of assessments"
* Started with a Google Doc, going through the standards.
* ELA Common Core *code* Pulled out anchor standards with technology. Tech may apply to only some grade levels.
* [Technology Skills Checklist for Online Assessments](http://t.co/HIecN7CLaR)
* Once they broke down the standards, looked at tools to support. Most of the statements don't reference technology.
* Geography used specific technologies the most.
* PARCC is only the assessment, Common Core is the standards.

#Using iBooks Author To Write & Publish Student Work
* Kids don't see the value in writing for one. 
* No sense of contribution to society
* They are not leaving behind a legacy
* Developed the idea, all students wrote a chapter one, then collaborated on which parts will be included in the final book.
* Let Ss write about what the Ss are struggling with
* Math Our Way, math textbook written by 6th graders.
* Other books
	* It was a dark and stormy classroom
	* Canterbury Remixed
	* May we suggest...?
* Worked with the speed pathologist and some autistic students to write **Social Skills Volume I** Became the stars.
* 19 books published in the last two years. ~22,000 downloads. 
* In 48+ countries
* It's more than the downloads, motivation
* Get permission slips/media release form/etc
* Wants more student and teacher created ebooks

* Final Thoughts
	* Kids need to be creating
	* Share!
	* Sense of community
