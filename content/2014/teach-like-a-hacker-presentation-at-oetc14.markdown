I'm finally getting a chance to post my presentation and supplemental materials from the OETC14 conference!

[Presentation Link](http://dl.ryancollins.org/TLaH.pdf)

["Ryan is a hottie" .mp3](http://dl.ryancollins.org/JEJ-RyanIs.mp3)

["Ryan is a hottie" .m4r](http://dl.ryancollins.org/JEJ-RyanIs.m4r)

[Backchannel log](http://dl.ryancollins.org/tlahoetc14.log.html)

And you know, for all the flack I get about trying to promote IRC, the back channel log is the most dialogue I've ever seen happen in a session! :-)
