The honeymoon isn't over yet with the Touch. The battery so far hasn't
had a problem lasting through the day, and that is with me using wifi a
lot! The keyboard is interesting. As long as I keep typing the
autocorrect really does its thing, making email and this post pretty
easy to do. I do have problems typing certain characters, but I think
that is a combination of me learning and the case I have.

I ordered a couple for the district and will have a couple of teachers
trying of our in their classrooms.
