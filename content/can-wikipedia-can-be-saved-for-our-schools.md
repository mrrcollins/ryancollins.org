Andy Carvin on his blog presents a case for [Turning Wikipedia into an
Asset for Schools][]. Instead of blindly following what's in Wikipedia,
use it to present "teachers with an excellent authentic learning
activity in which students can demonstrate their skills as scholars":

> [...]Take a group of fifth grade students and break them into groups,
> with each group picking a topic that interests them. Any topic.
> Dolphins, horses, hockey, you name it.
>
> Next, send the groups of kids to Wikipedia to look up the topic they
> selected. [...] The horse, for example, has an extensive entry on the
> website. It certainly looks accurate and informative, but is it?
> Unfortunately, there are no citations for any of the facts claimed
> about horses on the page.
>
> [...]The group of students breaks down the content on the page into
> manageable chunks, each with a certain amount of facts that need to be
> verified. The students then spend the necessary time to fact-check the
> content.  
>  Once the Wikipedia entry has been fact-checked, the teacher creates a
> Wikipedia login for the class. They go to the entry's talk page and
> present their findings, laying out every idea that needs to be
> corrected. Then, they edit the actual entry to make the corrections,
> with all sources cited. Similarly, for all the parts of the entry
> they've verified as accurate, they list sources confirming it.
