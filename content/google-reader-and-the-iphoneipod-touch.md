Using my RSS reader of choice Google Reader, I've discovered two ways to
use it on my iPod Touch. If I navigate to:  
http://google.com/reader/m I get a slightly different interface than
using http://google.com/m\#reader. The former address gives me a nice
icon when I add it to my home screen, but the latter address works
better on my touch.

Does anyone know what the differences are? Why can't I get the nice icon
to add to my home screen with the second address?
