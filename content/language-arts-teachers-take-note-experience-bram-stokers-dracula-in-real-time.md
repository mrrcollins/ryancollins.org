[Dracula][]

> Experience Bram Stoker's Dracula in a new way -- in real time. Dracula
> is an epistolary novel (a novel written as a series of letters or
> diary entries,) and this blog will publish each diary entry on the day
> that it was written by the narrator so that the audience may
> experience the drama as the characters would have.

What a cool way to introduce classic literature to student's brought up
with blogs and social networking. I've subscribed to the feed and can't
wait to read the novel through [Google Reader][].
