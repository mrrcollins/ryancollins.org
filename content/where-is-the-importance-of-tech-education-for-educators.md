I am absolutely shocked at the lack of technology use by
<span style="font-weight: bold">teachers</span> and
<span style="font-weight: bold">technology coordinators</span>. I've
been to several technology coordinator meetings, there will usually be
30 or 40 tech coordinators in the room, and as I scan the audience,
there are only a handful taking notes into their computer. Most are
writing on yellow legal pads! Maybe I'm using technology for
technology's sake, but I respectfully disagree in this example. By
putting my notes in electronic format I'm already going to be able to
easily file and more importantly find this information at a later date.

This extends to the eTech Ohio Conference this past February. It seems
that most <span style="font-weight: bold">teachers</span> and
<span style="font-weight: bold">technology staff</span>, while promoting
the virtues of technology integration, don't use it themselves. When you
start mentioning RSS, Twitter, Wikis, a lot don't have any clue what
you're talking about. At least most know what blogging is now.

What's the solution? <span style="font-weight: bold">Teachers</span>
need to be shown how, at the very least, technology can save them time.
If technology can save a teacher 10 minutes a day, that 1,830 minutes of
the course of the school year, or 30.5 hours. Even if they need a 4 hour
training on how to save those ten minutes, they still come out ahead! I
believe that once they see that the computer is supposed to save them
time as opposed to taking more time, it will ease further staff
development.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Technology Coordinators</span>, you need
to be guiding the administrators and teachers in your district. If you
don't use technology, then there is less incentive for anyone else to
use it. Automate repetitive tasks. Use RSS. Setup a blog. Subscribe to a
podcast.
