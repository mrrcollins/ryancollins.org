The conference took place over a week ago and I'm still trying to get my
head wrapped around all the information I collected! I did learn one
very important thing. My ID badge this year said Librarian/Media
Specialist, and I learned that it makes it a lot easier to walk through
the vendor area. They didn't seem as interested in talking to me. :-)

I'm hoping to get more things put together and online. I still have to
collect the notes from my session and put them online, and also to tag
them into del.icio.us (thanks Alvin!).

Every year I go hoping to take away one new thing to get excited about,
but that is getting harder to do. Technology in education has become
such a commodity that the break throughs are getting more and more
uncommon. I'm also torn with the problem of too many choices. It's hard
for me to focus on one thing, I want to implement them all!
