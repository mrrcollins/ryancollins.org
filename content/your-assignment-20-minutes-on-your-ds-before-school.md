Scottish authorities [have begun other trials of 'More Brain Training
with Dr Kawashima' on the Nintendo DS][] in 16 schools:

> A 20-minute burst of the 'brain training' exercises on Nintendo's DS
> console at the start of the day apparently improves performance in
> maths tests by as much as 10 per cent, according to a Scottish study.

The results of the completed 10 week study certainly are fascinating:

> In a maths test at the end of the trial, their performance improved by
> an average 10 per cent, and the time to complete the test also dropped
> from 17 minutes to 13 minutes and nine seconds.

Pretty impressive results, although I don't know what game they're
talking about, unless it happens to be *Brain Age 2*. Checking Amazon UK
shows a DS game called *More Brain Traing*, which may just be a relabel
*Brain Age 2*. I guess I'll have to do some more checking. What a solid
return on your investment though. It would cost a class of 25 \$3,750 to
outfit the entire class with a DS. Throw in the DS Browser and you have
even more ways to integrate it into your classroom.

How long until a company comes out with a mobile version of Brain Age 2
that you can play from any mobile computing device?
