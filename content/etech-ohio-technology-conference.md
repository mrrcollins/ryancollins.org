After reading [John's blog post][] yesterday, I realized that not only
haven't I posted anything, I haven't even begun to look at what sessions
I want to go to at the eTech conference. Since I present at 8:00am
Monday morning, I've been more focused on that.

Through the Online Conference Planner I've begun to setup the sessions I
want to go to, and I will be publishing my [calendar through Google
Calendar][].
