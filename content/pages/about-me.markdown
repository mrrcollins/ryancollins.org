# In the beginning

My first computer experience came in the form of the TRS-80 Color Computer in the summer of 1982. It didin’t have any way to save programs, but I taught myself CoCo Extended Basic, writing a “Lunar Lander” type game. Unfortunately, it was lost since it could be saved, but I did write down the entire program. Too bad I have no idea where I placed that notebook.

The next year for Christmas I got my first computer, an Atari 800XL, one 1050 disk drive, and 1025 dot matrix printer. I furthered my programming skills, and used this computer up until my junior year of college. During my freshman year of college, there were only two other computers in my corridor, an original IBM PC, and a Mac Plus. No one wanted to use the IBM, and the Mac Plus owner didn’t share, so my trusty 800xl became the word processing workhorse for my fellow students.

# After college

Although I started college as a Systems Analyst major, I graduated with Bachelor of Music, Music Education and promptly got a job with a local mom-and-pop computer store. This store contracted with a local bank for computer work, which blossomed into a full time job for me. I was able to buy my next computer, a Gateway 2000 486dx2-66 with 15″ monitor for $1,700. I dual-booted DOS/Windows and OS/2.

I was soon hired as an elementary music teacher with Findlay City Schools. While there I received my masters degree in educational technology and move from music teacher to network administrator.

# Kenton City Schools

During the summer of 2000 I was hired as the Technology Coordinator of the Kenton City Schools District. At the time, approximately 30 of the 350 computers of Kenton City Schools had Internet access, files were stored on floppy disks, and e-mail was intermittent. Since then, 300 additional computers have been added to the network, and all have Internet access. The 650 total machines run several operating systems: Mac OS X, Windows 2000/XP, and Linux. Each of the 2,100 students and 150 staff has their own network home folder, and through network logins can use any computer in their building retaining access to their own desktop and files.
