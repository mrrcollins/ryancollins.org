Since I am home this week, I decided to get caught up on some projects.
The big one was working on getting an [interactive whiteboard setup
going with a Nintendo Wiimote and an infrared pen][]. This morning, I
finally got my infrared pen working. What I did was bought a cheap LED
flashlight from Walmart and replaced one of the LEDs with an infrared
LED, the Radio Shack 276-143 to be exact.

After checking that the pen worked, I downloaded the [Wiimote
interactive whiteboard software][] and it worked! I'll try to get some
pictures and a video up, but I don't know if I'll have time today.

Next goal is to find some whiteboard software to use with it. For right
now I'm just using [Inkscape][].
