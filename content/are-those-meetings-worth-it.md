The site uses actual salary info for your area to calculate the cost per
meeting. I tried it with a typical scenario, 3 elementary teachers and a
principal meeting. The cost came to \$1.41 a minute, or \$84.60 an hour.
An administrator meeting with 4 principals and the superintendent jumps
up to \$2.84 a minute (\$170.40 an hour!). Might be something to bring
up the next time you are sitting in a meeting that isn't accomplishing
anything.
