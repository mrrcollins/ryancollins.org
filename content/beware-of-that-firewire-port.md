There is a new technique that allows an attacker to [unlock a Windows
machine or login without a password][]. This [vulnerability also affects
OS X][]. Right now the hack currently requires a Linux laptop, but it
could conceivably make its way to modified iPods.

To protect yourself you'll need to disable Firewire in your PC BIOS, or
[on the Mac][] you will need to [set the Open Firmware password][].
