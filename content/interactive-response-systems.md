devices in our classrooms, it hit me that they could be used as an
interactive student response system (ISRS). Since current ISRSs are
around \$100 per person, why not invest in a more useful device such as
the iPod Touch, Sony PSP, or Nintendo DS (with Opera)?

I found one company that already is thinking this way, [Pocket Mobility
with their Quizzler Pro][] product. Me on the other hand, loves the
challenge of coding something up myself.

Has anyone worked with ISRSs? What did you like? What didn't you like?
Is this something I should look at as a summer project? :-)
