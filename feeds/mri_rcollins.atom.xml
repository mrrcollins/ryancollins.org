I have about 20, with several different registrars. If I was smart, I would consolidate them under one registrar, but, even then, checking expirations on the domains is a pain. I usually have autorenew turned on, but I still like to know when they are getting close to expiration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before re-inventing the wheel, I did a Google search, and found &lt;a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/domain-check-script.html"&gt;Domain Expiration Check Shell Script&lt;/a&gt;. It worked pretty well, except for a few top level domains like .me which didn't work. I modified the script, and just had to put some finishing touches on it today (.com, .net,  and .org was broken). Check &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/mrrcollins/9a668109fa8a97f9fb90"&gt;out the gist of the script on Github&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put all of my domains in a text file, and can then run it with &lt;code&gt;./domain-check -f mydomains.txt&lt;/code&gt;. It's pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="domains"></category><category term="bash"></category></entry></feed>
