</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Pandora Gilboa Local Schools<br />
R. Todd Schmutz - Superintendent<br />
Dr. Gene Lloyrd - Director of Technology</p>
<p>As part of the project the student get to keep the machine when they
graduate from school.</p>
<p>The netbooks weren't powerful enough, so now they've moved to more
robust laptops.</p>
<p>How the idea was born<br />
- Textbook costs and weight in book bags<br />
- Utilize 21st century learning skills and tools</p>
<p>Need for change<br />
- Only 28% of Ohio students (2011) who took the ACT met all four
college readiness benchmarks<br />
- 1968 Divergent Thinking Study by George Land - Created tests to
identify geniuses.<br />
? example question: How many uses of a a paperclip? 10 is normal, 200
is genius<br />
?? 3-5 year olds, 98% genius<br />
?? 8-10 year olds 30%<br />
?? 13-15 year olds 12%<br />
?? Adults (31 year average) 2%<br />
?? (The same group of students)</p>
<p>Finite curriculum that we assess with a series of multiple choice
questions.</p>
<p>Need to focus on how we are teaching students, we currently focus too
much on the what.</p>
<p>Educators spend too much of their class time transferring knowledge.
Then assign homework to be completed when the teacher isn't around.</p>
<p>If you're using the iPad in the same way you used the textbook, you
haven't fundamentally changed the delivery of content.</p>
<p>Flip the classroom<br />
- Transfer knowledge is the homework<br />
- Class time is spent answering/clarifying the knowledge that was
learned for homework.</p>
<p>Example old lesson:<br />
Round robin reading of the material, teacher adds their commentary
through a powerpoint, then homework is assigned.</p>
<p>Flipping the classroom<br />
Transfer happens on student's time, classwork consists of working
through questions about the material.</p>
<p>Barriers to flipping the classroom<br />
- Availability and reliability of technology<br />
- Teacher resistance to change<br />
- The learning to read, reading to learn curve. Starting in grades >4
it's easier to work, students can read for instruction.<br />
- Educating parents about this chift in teaching</p>
<p>Advantages of flipping<br />
- More time is spent on applied learning<br />
- 3Cs communication, collaboration, creative thinking<br />
- Student centered classroom</p>
<p>If the presentation was flipped<br />
- Participants would have been required to watch the presentation
before hand<br />
- Broken up into groups, watch videos of teachers in the classroom,
discuss<br />
- Present findings to the group</p>
<p>Implementation<br />
- What's the home situation like? How many siblings share a computer?<br />
- Ownership of the laptops, students take care of the equipment.<br />
- Started with 8th graders<br />
-</p>
<p>Q: Internet access for free/reduced?<br />
A: Not provided.</p>
<p>Q: Buying textbooks?<br />
A: Up to the textbook companies. Should they even buy textbooks?</p>
<p>Q: How do teachers with multiple preps do it?<br />
A: Building it out slowly. Once it's done, it's done.</p>
<p>Where do good ideas come from?<br />
- Does chance favor the connected mind?<br />
- Steven Johnson video<br />
? Recurring patterns to innovations<br />
?? Slow hunch<br />
??? Good ideas come from the collisions of other ideas that are
stewing<br />
??? Tim Berners-Lee, WWW. Took ten years<br />
??? Sometimes it takes a hunch from someone else to combine with
another hunch for the eureka moment.<br />
? Great driver in innovations is connectivity</p>
<p>Important to provide<br />
- Quality tech<br />
- Adequate bandwidth<br />
- Adequate tech support<br />
? 7:15am on Tuesday, 3:15pm on Thursdays</p>
<p>William Daggett Rigor/Relevance Framework</p>
<p>Filtering<br />
- We filter, exercise in futility<br />
- By law, not necessary at home<br />
- Ultrasurf: Created by the government for Egyptians to surf</p>
<p>Move to year round usage?</p>
<p>8th grade student<br />
- Watching the lecture gives him the freedom to pause/rewatch and
repeat.<br />
- Can just ask a question if totally lost</p>
<p>Science teacher<br />
- Gives students the ability to take responsibility of their own
learning.</p>
<p>Some students don't like the flipped classroom, they're used to the
currecnt way instruction is given.</p>
<p>Q: How do you do teacher training<br />
A: Training during the week. Additional training for the teachers with
classrooms that have netbooks.</p>
<p>Q: What do you say to someone who's afraid of failure on the state test
due to the change in structure?<br />
A: They've never had a student come back and say they didn't do as well
on a state test, they come back and tell how much better they are at
communicating. Supt: I want to know how the students are learning, and
believes that they do well on the tests.</p>
<p>Q: How much time is spent on homework?<br />
A: More time right now, as they learn, and not all teachers are doing
it yet.</p>
<p>Q: How are you planning on staying up with technology? Software
upgrades?<br />
A: Cloud computing has helped.</p>
<p>Teachers aren't excited about how easy it is to be fact checked. :-)</p>
<p>Q: How long is a video?<br />
A: Ten minutes average.</p>
<p>Q: How is video delivered?<br />
A: Google Apps with Google Sites</p>
<p>Q: When they leave what happens to licenced materials?<br />
A: District takes it off when the student leaves</p>
