&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking a lot lately about iPads, Chromebooks, Android
Tablets, and Linux laptops. In planning the next 5 years of technology

&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking a lot lately about iPads, Chromebooks, Android
Tablets, and Linux laptops. In planning the next 5 years of technology
in my school district, I know it will be mobile, but what device should
I be thinking about? And then I noticed something very curious about the
iPad and how people interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, when I've done professional development, there would always
be some participants that would question the complexity. “Why are there
so many steps?” “I’ll never remember all these!” Now with iPad training,
I very seldom hear these comments. In fact, with all the hoops one must
jump through on the iPad to do some tasks, people almost seem to enjoy
it. These are the same people that would be overwhelmed with the
complexity of doing the same task under desktop operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this the &lt;a href="http://www.mguhlin.org/2012/04/epiphany-of-experiences-ipads-in.html"&gt;epiphany&lt;/a&gt; that techies are missing? A device that defies
our expectations of technology? The iPad with its touch and non-window
interface turns the last 20 years of technology use on its head. For the
first time in 15 years, people are realizing that they can use a
&lt;a href="http://minimalmac.com/post/17758177061/microsofts-biggest-miss"&gt;computing platform that doesn’t have Microsoft Office on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reminded of a situation when I first bought the Nintendo Wii. At the
time, motion control was brand new, and I was playing my brother in a
first person shooter. He couldn’t quite get the hang of using the
controller, preferring wild swings instead of using the controller with
style and finesse. It was the first new gaming interface he had used
since the analog stick was added to the Nintendo 64 and he was
struggling. It seems we get too comfortable with what we know, instead
of pushing through to see what we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These same discussions are taking place with the new interface of
Windows 8. People are lamenting the loss of the desktop, even as
Microsoft assures them that the desktop will still be there when using
Windows 8 on a desktop or laptop computer. It’s funny in a way, I
remember these same arguments when the switch from Microsoft DOS to
Microsoft Windows was taking place. The writing is on the wall for the
desktop metaphor. People don’t want to manually manage their
&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/03/08/the-static-document-model-is-dying-rip-doc-xls-and-ppt/"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; anymore. Or the apps. And most importantly, their
computer. They want to use it to get stuff done, and they’ve found that
the iPad allows them to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As districts buy more and more iPads will the new paradigm of touch
computing with a tablet be the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had the new iPad for 24 hours, and it has already ruined me for all
other displays. I noticed it yesterday, as I was working on my 24"
1920x1080 monitor at school. It just looks bad after using the new iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had the new iPad for 24 hours, and it has already ruined me for all
other displays. I noticed it yesterday, as I was working on my 24"
1920x1080 monitor at school. It just looks bad after using the new iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an upgrade to the iPad 1, the new iPad is a no brainer upgrade. The
speed is amazing, but it's the display that is the future. I don't even
want to use my 11" Air anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more in-depth reviews from around the web, so I'm going to
try to pull out the little bits that may not be covered but I feel are
important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The #1 feature is the display, 2058x1536 in a 9.7" package is just
    amazing. This is the highest resolution screen I've ever used, and
    text looks as good as e-ink on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed of the device is a substantial improvement over the iPad 1 or
    iPhone 4. I haven't used the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S enough to
    compare the two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPhone/iPod Touch apps at 2x use retina resolutions for the devices,
    giving the apps a more pleasant display. If you are running an iPad
    that is already jailbroke, there are apps to allow you to do this
    with the older devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm using my ZAGG/mate bluetooth keyboard from my iPad 1 on it. The
    new iPad is very loose in the keyboard case, but it's useable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're still rocking an iPad 1, it's pretty much a no brainer to
upgrade. The decision from an iPad 2 is better left for others to help
you decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, the Apple Store online has refurbished iPad 1s for \$299
right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is a service that works almost identically to Dropbox. Their
differentiating feature is the fact that they use your Google Docs
account for storage. A downside to this is that you only have 1GB of
storage with normal accounts, but Google lets you add 20GB to that for
\$5 a year (compared to Dropbox costing \$10 a month for 50GB of space).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set up, you download the client, install it, and log into your Google
account or accounts. It lets you sync multiple Google accounts at the
same time, so I can use it with my work Google account, my professional
Google account, and my personal Google account. Insync creates a folder
in your home directory called Insync, and creates a folder for each one
of your accounts inside of it. Google Docs files show up as their
Microsoft Office equivilents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works really well, just as well as Dropbox. There are a few
annoyances, such as the inability to pause syncing (for example, if
you?re on slow connection), but for the price it?s hard for Dropbox to
beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tip I would recommend is to create a folder inside your Google
account folder and use that like you would use a Dropbox account. If
your Google Docs account is anything like mine, you have a ton of files
and very little organization. Since I?m using this basically as a
Dropbox replacement, I created a folder called DesktopSync, and I use
that like I would use my Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in a Google Apps for Education school district, your Google
accounts work fine with Insync. I haven?t tested it on our client
computers that students use yet. If it works there, it would be a very
nice solution to file access outside of the district.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="dropbox"></category><category term="Google"></category><category term="insync"></category></entry><entry><title>Beware of the echo chamber</title><link href="https://ryancollins.org/2011/11/30/beware-of-the-echo-chamber/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-11-30T13:33:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-11-30T13:33:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2011-11-30:/2011/11/30/beware-of-the-echo-chamber/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As my school district was preparing for a building levy back in November

(which did pass, yeah!!), I talked to community members what they felt
the chances for a new building were. Most of them were enthusiastic,
saying that they were hearing a lot of positive talk on Facebook. But
when I pointed out that their friends on Facebook were more likely to be
supportive since they were about the same age and had around the same
aged kids, the enthusiasm waned. As we connect virtually with more an
more people, are we enhancing this echo chamber, where like minded
individuals pat each other on the back and agree with everything is
said?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to follow people that may not agree with me or my ideas. While it
is important to have supporters, it is just as important to have someone
that pushes the boundaries. The trick is to be able to carry on a
constructive dialog without coming across preachy or to take things
personally. I’ve had &lt;strong&gt;heated&lt;/strong&gt; discussions with others that instead of
debating the conflict, they let emotion take over. When a conversation
becomes a personal attack, it is then time to take a step back and
revisit the discussion at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compromise seems to be a lost art in the present. The congressional
&lt;strong&gt;Super Committee&lt;/strong&gt; failure to come to a decision exemplifies this. We
cannot afford to not discuss rationally, accepting compromises when
needed, in the education of our students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversity is the spice of life. Your personal learning network should
contain individuals that have all different viewpoints. You’ll learn
just as much from them as from those you agree with.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="oped socialnetworking"></category></entry><entry><title>The Wingstand: a stand for your iPhone or iPad and the Apple Bluetooth Keyboard</title><link href="https://ryancollins.org/2011/11/16/the-wingstand-a-stand-for-your-iphone-or-ipad-and-the-apple-bluetooth-keyboard/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-11-16T20:38:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-11-16T20:38:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2011-11-16:/2011/11/16/the-wingstand-a-stand-for-your-iphone-or-ipad-and-the-apple-bluetooth-keyboard/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the first accessories I purchased with the original iPad was the

Apple Bluetooth Keyboard. I had grand plans of replacing my laptop with
the iPad. That didn't happen, Apple introduced the MacBook Air and I was
hooked, but I still held onto the BT keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I've been using it with my iPhone when I'm out and don't have
access to wifi. It works ok, but I was getting tired of constantly
moving the iPhone, trying to get it in a good place to use it with the
keyboard. I started looking online for solutions, since there were a ton
of iPad cases with BT keyboards, I was hoping there would be something
for the iPhone. It was then I stumbled across the &lt;a href="http://wingstand.com"&gt;Wingstand&lt;/a&gt;.
Consisting of two pieces of plastic, it can be used with or without the
BT keyboard to prop up your phone or tablet. It's not Apple specific. At
\$14.95 shipped it seems a little pricey for a couple pieces of plastic,
but it is made here in the USA and it does work really well. I'm typing
this post with my BT keyboard and using the iPhone (unfortunately I have
to use the iPhone in the portrait orientation since the Wordpress app
doesn't appear to switch to landscape). My original iPad fits with the
Apple case on, and so does my HP Touchpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to use an external keyboard with your iPhone or iPad,
this might be an inexpensive way to work. Let me know if there are any
other solutions I've missed in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student videos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is the 4 Cs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did we need the senior experience?&lt;br&gt;
- additional help&lt;br&gt;
- Social media experience&lt;br&gt;
- Main Street Madison - parent lead public forum. People were visiting
it for information instead of going to the school's website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan:&lt;br&gt;
- First year the students were hand picked for the pilot.&lt;br&gt;
- Wanted it to be part of the main website&lt;br&gt;
- want video and pictures in the blog&lt;br&gt;
- promoting the seniors&lt;br&gt;
- highlight videos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it evaluated&lt;br&gt;
- Students are earning language arts credit&lt;br&gt;
- students still have to take senior English&lt;br&gt;
- problem based learning&lt;br&gt;
- website hits&lt;br&gt;
- a lot less misconceptions posted on main street Madison&lt;br&gt;
- track top pages on site, blogs are consistently in the top 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People do want to hear about the academics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks&lt;br&gt;
- safety: signed aup, contract, loan agreement for equipment,&lt;br&gt;
- Money: permanent improvement funds,&lt;br&gt;
- Responsibility: AJ Huff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Don't be afraid to take risks, especially smart ones. " - Steve Jobs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: did you have to turn people away the 2nd year?&lt;br&gt;
A: received a list of 40 recommendations from the English dept.
Widdowed it down to 20, then discussed with the principal. 12 were asked
to apply, of which 10 did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: comments are blocked on the blogs, what about the FB page?&lt;br&gt;
A: FB page is new, but hopefully can turn negative comments to
positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Any plans to open it to others?&lt;br&gt;
A: not at this time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How did you come up with 6?&lt;br&gt;
A: Original plan was they would be paired, because they work
unsupervised in the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How will you use Facebook?&lt;br&gt;
A: Ultimate goal is to still drive traffic back to the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How often do the students post?&lt;br&gt;
A: In the beginning they tried 1 to 2 times a week, but that became an
issue with all the other projects. Now it's around once every 7-10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How do you handle their personal FB pages?&lt;br&gt;
A: That's really outside of the jurisdiction of the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How much do you change their articles?&lt;br&gt;
A: Quick edits, try not to change the message. Did have a problem with
one post, student talked about the whole family going to Florida for
spring break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Controversal issues in the school?&lt;br&gt;
A: Situation hasn't come up&lt;/p&gt;

R. Todd Schmutz - Superintendent&lt;br&gt;
Dr. Gene Lloyrd - Director of Technology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the project the student get to keep the machine when they
graduate from school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The netbooks weren't powerful enough, so now they've moved to more
robust laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the idea was born&lt;br&gt;
- Textbook costs and weight in book bags&lt;br&gt;
- Utilize 21st century learning skills and tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need for change&lt;br&gt;
- Only 28% of Ohio students (2011) who took the ACT met all four
college readiness benchmarks&lt;br&gt;
- 1968 Divergent Thinking Study by George Land - Created tests to
identify geniuses.&lt;br&gt;
? example question: How many uses of a a paperclip? 10 is normal, 200
is genius&lt;br&gt;
?? 3-5 year olds, 98% genius&lt;br&gt;
?? 8-10 year olds 30%&lt;br&gt;
?? 13-15 year olds 12%&lt;br&gt;
?? Adults (31 year average) 2%&lt;br&gt;
?? (The same group of students)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finite curriculum that we assess with a series of multiple choice
questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to focus on how we are teaching students, we currently focus too
much on the what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators spend too much of their class time transferring knowledge.
Then assign homework to be completed when the teacher isn't around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're using the iPad in the same way you used the textbook, you
haven't fundamentally changed the delivery of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flip the classroom&lt;br&gt;
- Transfer knowledge is the homework&lt;br&gt;
- Class time is spent answering/clarifying the knowledge that was
learned for homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example old lesson:&lt;br&gt;
Round robin reading of the material, teacher adds their commentary
through a powerpoint, then homework is assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flipping the classroom&lt;br&gt;
Transfer happens on student's time, classwork consists of working
through questions about the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barriers to flipping the classroom&lt;br&gt;
- Availability and reliability of technology&lt;br&gt;
- Teacher resistance to change&lt;br&gt;
- The learning to read, reading to learn curve. Starting in grades &gt;4
it's easier to work, students can read for instruction.&lt;br&gt;
- Educating parents about this chift in teaching&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages of flipping&lt;br&gt;
- More time is spent on applied learning&lt;br&gt;
- 3Cs communication, collaboration, creative thinking&lt;br&gt;
- Student centered classroom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the presentation was flipped&lt;br&gt;
- Participants would have been required to watch the presentation
before hand&lt;br&gt;
- Broken up into groups, watch videos of teachers in the classroom,
discuss&lt;br&gt;
- Present findings to the group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation&lt;br&gt;
- What's the home situation like? How many siblings share a computer?&lt;br&gt;
- Ownership of the laptops, students take care of the equipment.&lt;br&gt;
- Started with 8th graders&lt;br&gt;
-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Internet access for free/reduced?&lt;br&gt;
A: Not provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Buying textbooks?&lt;br&gt;
A: Up to the textbook companies. Should they even buy textbooks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How do teachers with multiple preps do it?&lt;br&gt;
A: Building it out slowly. Once it's done, it's done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do good ideas come from?&lt;br&gt;
- Does chance favor the connected mind?&lt;br&gt;
- Steven Johnson video&lt;br&gt;
? Recurring patterns to innovations&lt;br&gt;
?? Slow hunch&lt;br&gt;
??? Good ideas come from the collisions of other ideas that are
stewing&lt;br&gt;
??? Tim Berners-Lee, WWW. Took ten years&lt;br&gt;
??? Sometimes it takes a hunch from someone else to combine with
another hunch for the eureka moment.&lt;br&gt;
? Great driver in innovations is connectivity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important to provide&lt;br&gt;
- Quality tech&lt;br&gt;
- Adequate bandwidth&lt;br&gt;
- Adequate tech support&lt;br&gt;
? 7:15am on Tuesday, 3:15pm on Thursdays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Daggett Rigor/Relevance Framework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filtering&lt;br&gt;
- We filter, exercise in futility&lt;br&gt;
- By law, not necessary at home&lt;br&gt;
- Ultrasurf: Created by the government for Egyptians to surf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move to year round usage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8th grade student&lt;br&gt;
- Watching the lecture gives him the freedom to pause/rewatch and
repeat.&lt;br&gt;
- Can just ask a question if totally lost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science teacher&lt;br&gt;
- Gives students the ability to take responsibility of their own
learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some students don't like the flipped classroom, they're used to the
currecnt way instruction is given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How do you do teacher training&lt;br&gt;
A: Training during the week. Additional training for the teachers with
classrooms that have netbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What do you say to someone who's afraid of failure on the state test
due to the change in structure?&lt;br&gt;
A: They've never had a student come back and say they didn't do as well
on a state test, they come back and tell how much better they are at
communicating. Supt: I want to know how the students are learning, and
believes that they do well on the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How much time is spent on homework?&lt;br&gt;
A: More time right now, as they learn, and not all teachers are doing
it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How are you planning on staying up with technology? Software
upgrades?&lt;br&gt;
A: Cloud computing has helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers aren't excited about how easy it is to be fact checked. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How long is a video?&lt;br&gt;
A: Ten minutes average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How is video delivered?&lt;br&gt;
A: Google Apps with Google Sites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: When they leave what happens to licenced materials?&lt;br&gt;
A: District takes it off when the student leaves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capitalism isn't unlimited in its ability to create (?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE TERM IS CALLED FUD IN TECHNOLOGY CIRCLES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If school leadership is the problem, then everyone else doesn't have to
change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NO BLUEBERRY STORY TODAY. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall street journal: abolish local school boards.&lt;br&gt;
The farther the decision maker is from the child, the dumber the
decision gets. Core principle one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People used to rally against the soviet central planning. Concentrate
all power in the hands of a small group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrible trends:&lt;br&gt;
Demographics-percentage of taxpayers with children in school in Ohio is
less than 20%. A lot of people have the been there,done that attitude.
They have forgotten something. Public education has two reasons for ring
developed. Individual benefit for students, the public good. Everybody
benefits when they support the public schools. Every aspect of their
quality of life is tied toward their local schools. Higher student
achievement, lower crime rates. After 7-10 years, tax base rises. Teen
pregnancy falls. ER use as primary care facility falls. Vote no leads to
the degradation of their community&lt;br&gt;
Media is a "tad" negative. :-) negativity sells because we like it.
Schadenfreude.&lt;br&gt;
At the community's turf, at the communities convenience.&lt;br&gt;
The great clanning of America. School is there to melt us. What if no
one ones to be melted anymore? "I don't want my kids with 'them'".
Races, socioeconomic, political.&lt;br&gt;
Tinker vs. school board, Vietnam armband protest. Past rights: "I had
the right to sit down and shut up."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents are used to getting an advanced customizations. Every student
getting an IEP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engage your community, positive for schools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the best of times. For the first time we have to teach all
children to high levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education greats weren't the a ha moment, writings by the father of
public education, Thomas Jefferson. "Rake the genius from the rubbish."
we didn't need a lot of people to think for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1965-77% of the workforce was low level skills. Making enough money for
the American dream. Currently 13%. In 5 years, 5%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need thinkers, we can't afford not too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools and their staff have the power to change moral sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formal track of the great conversation, from the BOE. Go to where the
community is for meetings. There are millions that hated schools. They
hate going there. Go to them. In teams. Staff should front load the
conversation. Americans trust teachers more than BOE of administrators.
America trusts the classifies employees even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community understanding. The community doesn't understand what you do.
Jamie's magic list. Things added in the last century.&lt;br&gt;
Not added a single minute to the school calendar in 7 decades. Download
at Jamie Vollmer.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The golden age of education never existed. Must break the mental model
of what school is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community must trust the schools. As understanding grows, so does trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community permission to do it differently. Need to stop grouping
students. Y date of manufacture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community support. Can't go from A to B without going through C, the
community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Ss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop bad mouthing others in publics. Gripe to your spouse, that's
    why we have them. :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift your negatives to the positives. The more negative you become
    the more you compromise your immune system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share. Share something positive about what's going on in your
    school. Something positive happens every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustain the effort, keep this up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start. Start this now. Whoever molds the public sentiment wins the
    day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joined: moral and practical thing to do. We need thinkers. Poorly
educated people are desperate, and desperate people are dangerous.&lt;br&gt;

CAPITAL CONFERENCE. MY EDITORIALS ARE IN ALL CAPS. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mississinawa Valley Local school district&lt;br&gt;
- Pilot school for eDays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replace snow days with eDays?&lt;br&gt;
- ancedotes: take away sled time? :-) Big learning experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background/History&lt;br&gt;
- Supt. brought in through a video&lt;br&gt;
- Learning can continue when the instructor can't be in front of the
students&lt;br&gt;
- District covers 80 square miles, miss days after snowfall due to
wind&lt;br&gt;
- Superintendent Wendel formalizes plan that is used as a basis for the
house bill&lt;br&gt;
- House bill dies, could be due to lobbying from the AFT&lt;br&gt;
- Applied for waiver days from the ODE to try it out.&lt;br&gt;
- Big response from across the nation, spent a lot of time in
interviews&lt;br&gt;
- Governor Kasich re-institutes the 5 calamity days and adds 3 online
days to the budget bill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School plan&lt;br&gt;
- Teachers are already required to come in two days in the summer. One
was used for eDay PD&lt;br&gt;
- The other day was used to complete lessons&lt;br&gt;
- Teachers were paid for two days, but more was put in on their own
time.&lt;br&gt;
- Prepare students and parents. Teachers took class time to show the
students, parent meetings in the evening in an open computer lab&lt;br&gt;
- Variety of lessons, and a student product (an assignment and
assessment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eLesson Components&lt;br&gt;
- Target&lt;br&gt;
Pick some standards that are hard to hit in the classroom due to other
standards&lt;br&gt;
- Instruction&lt;br&gt;
Reading&lt;br&gt;
Podcasts&lt;br&gt;
Vodcasts&lt;br&gt;
- Teacher contact information&lt;br&gt;
--Duplicate the learning that occurs in a normal day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson types&lt;br&gt;
- Rubric was used to grade the lesson: Basic, Intermediate, and
Advanced&lt;br&gt;
- Everyone was required to have a Basic lesson, but the goal was for
the teachers to move to intermediate and/or advanced lesson plans&lt;br&gt;
- Component of an eDay Lesson: Student Tasks, Student Product&lt;br&gt;
- See Darke County ESC for rubric&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens on an eDay&lt;br&gt;
- Teachers/students notified&lt;br&gt;
- Teaches enable lessons, using First Class&lt;br&gt;
- Teachers will be available for consilt during day either by phone or
email&lt;br&gt;
- Students have 2 weeks to complete assignments if needed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if students don't have internet?&lt;br&gt;
- Initial survey showed that only 11% did not have Internet, 50%
free/reduced lunches&lt;br&gt;
- Discuss with students ahead of time&lt;br&gt;
- Weather permitting:&lt;br&gt;
? Community building open with laptops and tech coordinator&lt;br&gt;
? School building will be open&lt;br&gt;
- 2 week window to complete assignments&lt;br&gt;
? Work on them during non-instructional times of school day&lt;br&gt;
? After school hours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sample Pages&lt;br&gt;
- First class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHERE IS MOODLE? GOOGLE DOCS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teacher is usually online to assist during the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only open up the current eDay's lesson, didn't want students to
    complete all the eday work on the first day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHY NOT? IF THEY CAN COMPLETE IT SUCCESSFULLY, WHY NOT LET THEM COMPLETE
IT ALL?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issues that cropped up: lessons took too much time, computer sharing
    in households with multiple students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teachers learned a lot of what works and what doesn't work the first
    year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Found out some students only had dial-up, video was difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICE USE OF A DIGITAL CAMERA TO "SCAN" IN PAGES TO PUT ON A WEBPAGE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lessons are stand alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I HOPE THEY AREN'T TEACHING SKILLS IN ISOLATION, THEY SHOULD BUILD
SOMEWHAT ON THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR (MAKE UP DAYS WOULDN'T BE UNTIL
ALL CALAMATY DAYS ARE EXHAUSTED, WHICH WOULDN'T BE UNTIL JAN OR FEB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surfing the Internet took a lot a time because there is so much
    stuff out there. Actually inspired the teacher to integrate other
    resources that were found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elementary PE: Timed sit-ups, push-ups, and measure reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NO SHOVELING SNOW? :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teacher's daughter wanted to do some of the activities after the
    eDay ended&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistic Comparisons&lt;br&gt;
- 100% of the teachers believed their eLessons were of high
instructional value&lt;br&gt;
- 72% of the students said they were able to learn by completing the
eLessons&lt;br&gt;
- 80% of the parents thought the lessons were of high instructional
value&lt;br&gt;
- 52% of the students said the learning equaled what they learn on a
"regular" day, 60% of parents&lt;br&gt;
- 100% of teachers, 57% of students, 67% of parents believed the school
should continue the eDay program&lt;br&gt;
- Older siblings liked helping the younger students complete some of
their tasks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;br&gt;
- Too much time between the actual eDay and when they are due. More
information and tasks were given than what would have been given in a
normal class period&lt;br&gt;
- Students were frustrated in the completion of the lesson and the time
it took&lt;br&gt;
- Students are passive learners&lt;br&gt;
- There should be no athletic practices during school time on eDays&lt;br&gt;
- Parents view parental involvment as something that occurs inside the
school&lt;br&gt;
- Incorporate this type of technology throughout the year&lt;br&gt;
- Online time cannot equal chair time&lt;br&gt;
- Automated system for product return is necassary&lt;br&gt;
- Need a consistent, agreed upon method for student/teacher
communication&lt;br&gt;
- Lack of completion consequences needs to be more fully developed&lt;br&gt;
- More parent/student prep needed&lt;br&gt;
- Need to have a contingency plan before you need the contengency plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COULD AN EDAY BE USED TO ALLOW TEACHERS PD DAYS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONTIGENCY PLAN FOR SERVER ISSUES?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q/A&lt;br&gt;
Q:How do you deal with students special needs?&lt;br&gt;
A: Modified classroom teacher lessons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How did you structure your pilot?&lt;br&gt;
A: 100% of the teachers involved, followed the steps listed above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: If two weeks are too long, are you going to change? Do teachers
prepare lessons for each subject in self-contained classrooms?&lt;br&gt;
A: Havent approached the two week window. Teachers create lessons for
each subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Moodle?&lt;br&gt;
A: Looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Costs?&lt;br&gt;
A: Practically nothing, since First Class was already in place. Already
had days in place for PD. Probably 4 or 5 hours for each lesson.
Research takes time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Union buy in?&lt;br&gt;
A: Union and administration identified the need and mutually agreed to
it. No one wanted to be there mid-June. Waiver days gave them two
additional days at Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: No computer?&lt;br&gt;
A: Places open for computer use, and two weeks to have things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Outside of snow days, such as no electricity due to winds/ice.&lt;br&gt;
A: Discuss as a district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Is there a real problem with students working ahead?&lt;br&gt;
A: It depends on the teachers and how the lesson was designed. What's
in their lessons, how it's set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How did you report this to the state department?&lt;br&gt;
A: The survey data was reported to the state, along with the waivers
for the eDays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comment: Mt. Vernon had a day without electricity, so they just used the

&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a pretty high tech article, but the benefits
outweigh the work that it requires. I'm going to talk about using
&lt;a href="http://cloudflare.com"&gt;cloudflare.com&lt;/a&gt; to cache your website and offer IPv6 compatibility.
For this to work you have to be using your own domain name and have
access to change the namerservers for your domain. If you cannot do
this, then you can't take advantage of &lt;a href="http://cloudflare.com"&gt;cloudflare.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To speed up access to a website, the larger sites around the Internet
cache data as close as possible to the end user, usually using some sort
of content delivery network (CDN). For the enduser, that speeds up
access to the website, since instead of a US user having to transfer
data from a UK website, the US user would only need to pull it from a
closer server. There are also other tricks that CDNs use to lower
bandwidth usage and increase speed. Cloudflare acts like a CDN on your
behalf, automatically caching your website around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IPv6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPv6 is the next version of the Internet addressing protocol, set to
replace the current IPv4. If you have an IPv4 address you can't talk to
a user with an IPv6 address and vice versa. Most clients now support
both at once, but until all the connections between you and a website
upgrade their equipment and software to IPv6, you are still going to be
using IPv4 addressing for awhile. This isn't true in Asia, where they've
exhausted their IPv4 addresses and there are users there that are only
getting an IPv6 address. If you only have an IPv6 address, then you only
have access to about 10,000 websites that are set up for IPv6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter Cloudflare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once configured, Cloudflare manages connections to your website, caching
the content. And with a simple switch on their website, you can turn on
IPv6 access to your website. &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org"&gt;ryancollins.org&lt;/a&gt; is now on Cloudflare's
network and should be accessible over IPv6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should you sign up?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to run it for awhile and see if any issues crop up. I just
noticed the "Threat Alerts" on my dashboard, where Cloudflare already
has blocked a couple of botnets from accessing the site. I've played
around with different caching plugins for Wordpress, but Cloudflare
seems like a lot better solution, especially since it doesn't require
any work. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="caching"></category><category term="cloudflare"></category><category term="wordpress"></category></entry><entry><title>Look out, there's a new tablet in town and it's HOT!</title><link href="https://ryancollins.org/2011/09/28/look-out-theres-a-new-tablet-in-town-and-its-hot/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-09-28T16:17:00-04:00</published><updated>2011-09-28T16:17:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2011-09-28:/2011/09/28/look-out-theres-a-new-tablet-in-town-and-its-hot/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Announcing the Kindle Fire&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon announced a few new Kindles today, the most important, in my
mind, is the Kindle Fire. It is a 7" tablet running a specialized
version of Android. The shocker was the price, \$199. With todays
announcement, every school district that is looking at mobile devices
will need to take a pause and examine what the Fire has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that price point, it undercuts the iPod Touch by \$30. It also
sacrifices a camera and microphone. But it makes up for those
deficiencies by offering a larger and better display. The main problem
with the Fire would be the lack of applications for the educational
market. Of course you have access to all the Kindle books, and the
explicitly list full color children's books for it, so it may be just a
matter of time before educational software takes off on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Does size matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our iOS pilot programs with iPod Touches and iPads it has become
pretty clear that it is hard to convince teachers that the small screen
of the iPod Touch can still be used for content creation. The students,
I've noticed, don't mind using the iPod Touch, so for them, size doesn't
matter. When it comes to content such as PDFs and books, the larger
screen size would be very advantageous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theft is also an issue in school, but the larger size of the Fire may be
a deterrent. The Fire would also be able to be used by more than one
student at a time due to it's size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Waiting..&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try to hold off any further mobile purchases until the Fire
is released and I get a chance to use one. I could see it replacing a
lot of iPod Touches this Christmas, it will be interesting to see what
Apple has in store on October 4th. If the applications come, the Fire
will be a very compelling device for school districts.&lt;/p&gt;

Apple II was Broderbund's &lt;strong&gt;The PrintShop&lt;/strong&gt;, right after that pirated
copy of AppleWorks. For the first time, users could create posters,

page layout tools became more and more commonplace, the final product to
be shared was an 8 1/2" x 11" (or A4 :-)) sized sheet of paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The world is going mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs are all around us that the personal computer as we know it is
dying, to replaced with mobile technologies. Whenever I do PD,
especially with iOS devices or other portable devices, I tell the
participants that in 5 years everyone will be using portable devices
instead of computers. Unfortunately, this doesn't go over very well. The
most common concern is how will they word process. After thinking about
it, I realized what was wrong with this question. In the future you will
not be creating content that the final product will be the printed page.
You, or your students, will be creating content that will be consumed on
other mobile devices. The concept of the printed page is dying.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="mobile"></category></entry><entry><title>I've been hacked and you can learn from my mistakes. :-)</title><link href="https://ryancollins.org/2011/08/28/ive-been-hacked-and-you-can-learn-from-my-mistakes/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-08-28T16:52:00-04:00</published><updated>2011-08-28T16:52:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2011-08-28:/2011/08/28/ive-been-hacked-and-you-can-learn-from-my-mistakes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hacked!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I let my Wordpress installation rot. And it's entirely my fault.
Wordpress makes it so easy to keep it up to date now that there is no
excuse, so I do accept full responsibility! I'm lucky in the fact that
all the hacker&lt;br&gt;
did was rewrite my .htaccess file to redirect visitors to a malware
hosted site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After examining the Wordpress database, it appeared that it hadn't been
changed by the attacker, so I went about installing a new copy of
Wordpress. It went pretty smooth, and for right now I'm going for a
minimum amount of&lt;br&gt;
plugins and keeping the design pretty basic. As I was restoring, I
began to think of what the hacker might of had access to and what I
needed to do to protect myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if the attacker had access to the filesystem or could
    only append lines onto the .htaccess file. Why is this important?
    Your MySQL password for your Wordpress installation is listed in the
    wp-config.php file. If you allow access to your MySQL server from
    the outside world, an attacker armed with this username and password
    is free to make changes to your database, even making themselves an
    administrator. So before doing the installation, I changed my
    password to MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One plugin I use with Wordpress is &lt;a href="http://www.webdesigncompany.net/automatic-wordpress-backup/"&gt;Automatic Wordpress Backup&lt;/a&gt;.
    This makes daily backups of my Wordpress installation and stores
    them on Amazon S3. What I realized after this hack was that if the
    attacker had gotten access to administrator privileges, he could
    have wiped out every single backup I have. Worse yet, they could
    gain access to my access keys for Amazon S3. I went in and changed
    my Amazon S3 access keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I'm doing differently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be keeping up on Wordpress updates!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wp-config.php file, which contains some very important
    information on your Wordpress installation does not need to live in
    a web accessible directory such as your main Wordpress installation.
    I moved it up a directory. For example, if you installed Wordpress
    in \~/public-html/, you can put wp-config.php in \~/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once my installation was completed, I created a user for myself and
    made it an administrator. I then logged in as my new administrator
    account and deleted the default administrator. This protects against
    hacks that target the default admin account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched to Disqus for comments. The blog only had one user, and I
    didn't want to worry about being hacked giving up reader
    information. By using Disqus, I let them handle it. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed the CHAP Secure Login plugin for Wordpress. This
    protects logins by encrypting the password. Since I don't have an
    SSL certificate, my password would be "in the clear" without this
    plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be automating the download of my backups from Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week as I was working on a presentation, I had a slide where I
asked the participants to discuss among themselves. I wanted to set a
time limit, but I didn't want to have to switch out of Keynote, I wanted
it on the slide. It took me a couple of minutes, but I finally came up
with a quite clever solution, if I do say so myself. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I needed was a little countdown video that would count
down from 10. I started a new Keynote project, and created a ten second
countdown. Originally I used ten slides, with the transition taking a
second, so that when played it would count down in ten seconds. The
problem came when I wanted to export the movie. The minimum amount of
time I could show a slide was two seconds, and since I didn't want to
count down by two a new solution had to be made. So I deleted all the
slides in my presentation save one, and put 11 text boxes on it (10-0).
I then did a pop build in and out, and set the time for the build to be
one second. The out build would happen concurrently with the in build of
the next number, so I got a pretty cool effect as a bonus. I &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Countdown.mov"&gt;exported
this out as a Quicktime movie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in my presentation, I added a question text box with a build in
transition to occur after a click. Next, I added my movie with a build
in transition to appear. The secret is to set the movie to appear
however many seconds you want to wait. I set it at 60 seconds, so
participants actually had 70 seconds until it finished. It doesn't
appear until the 60 second mark has passed, and then counts down to 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Works better than I had hoped! You can &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Countdown.mov"&gt;download the movie
here&lt;/a&gt;. (right click and use Save
as...)&lt;/p&gt;

students and teachers, while trying not to stray to the "dark side" of
technology. The twitter hastag will be #rcpartvi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second presentation is Tuesday, "An iPad, Kindle, and iPod Touch
walked into a classroom..." at 3:45 - 4:30 pm in room: C213 - 215. This
session will explore the Kindle, the iPad, and the iPod and how they can
be used in the classroom. Alternative technologies will also be
presented and discussed. The Twitter hashtag will be #rcmobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both presentations I'll be using Google Docs, and will update this
site with urls to the presentations. I'm going to try to use the "View
together" feature, where participants can follow along and actually
converse if they have Google accounts. For audio, I've set up a
Shoutcast server and I'll be attempting to broadcast the audio live
while presenting. I don't know how well it's going to work, but it
should be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was using Evernote for writing, but it doesn't have a full screen
mode. To emulate the ability to sync my notes written in JDarkroom with
my other devices I use &lt;a href="http://db.tt/wYZUa8E"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; (Affiliate code in link,
&lt;a href="http://dropbox.com"&gt;dropbox.com&lt;/a&gt; is the website without the affiliate code). Now I just
save my notes into my Dropbox, and Dropbox takes care of syncing them
across my devices. The Dropbox app for Android allows me to edit text
files directly in the application, and there are several apps for iOS
devices that will let you do the same. For mark up in text files I use
John Gruber's &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. It's a very readable way to encode
formatting in a text file. There are several libraries that let you then
convert it to html or back to markdown. I installed the &lt;a href="http://c.hadcoleman.com/wordpress-plugins/wmd-editor-wordpress-plugin/"&gt;WMD plug in for
Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; which allows me to write in Markdown (or just copy and
paste from one of my files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's a little convoluted, and as soon as Evernote as a full screen
editor option I'll probably switch back to it, it does work for me. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

Touch walked into a classroom...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I decided that it would be
beneficial to plan on questions about Android, Android Tablets, and how
they may work in schools. The Consumer Electronics Show was held this
past week, and during it a bevy of manufacturers announced tablets, with
almost all of them running Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android is an open source operating system created at Google based on
Linux. Google allows distributes this OS free of charge to be used by
manufacturers and cellular providers on mobile devices. It competes
against other mobile operating systems such as Apple's iOS (used on the
iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch), Microsoft Windows Phone 7, RIM Blackberry
OS, and HP's WebOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased a Motorola Droid off of eBay and received it this past week.
I've been playing around with it for the last couple of days, so this
isn't so much as a review as it is my first impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My smartphone history&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little history about my past and smartphones. I bought my first
smartphone, a Motorola Q around 2007 (I think. :-)). While it was my
first taste of online connectivity whereever I was, it was also my first
taste of, as the French would say, le pew. It was slow, ate batteries
like it was going out of style, ugly, and would just restart for now
reason. I moved on to a Samsung Omnia, then an HTC Ozone. The Ozone, at
the time (mid 2009) was Verizon's most unlocked phone. It had wifi and
the GPS was useable. All in all, not a bad phone, but still running
Windows Mobile. In August I purchased a Palm Pre Plus, which was heaven
compared to the Ozone. What holds it back is not the OS (which feels
like it could be an Apple product) but the hardware and lack of apps. As
an aside, AT&amp;amp;T does not offer service in my area, so I've gotten by with
an iPod Touch (first gen represent!) I bought in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This "First Look" will try to focus on the software itself, since in the
Android universe the quality and quantity of devices would overshadow
any comments about the hardware of the Motorola Droid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Rundown&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things I like:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The back button: Until I used WebOS I hadn't really thought about
    how useful a back gesture (or button) could be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Widgets: It's nice to be able to put my calendar on a screen, or a
    battery life indicator with other information about the hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of applications: So far I've been able to find an
    application for everything I need. In the market place there are
    also tons of clones of iOS games, but for the most part these are
    inferior to their iOS counterpart. Rope Cut is not Cut the Rope for
    iOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things I don't like:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notifcation bar: To open notifications you have to click and hold on
    the top bar and then drag down. Why I can't just click on the top
    bar for notifications I don't know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application switching: Unless I'm missing something, the only way to
    switch apps is to either exit back to home and click on the item or
    hold down the home key until the recently used applications show up.
    And heaven forbid you want to return to an open browser window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigation in applications: This is not consistant. Some apps, like
    imo.im (the instant messaging app I use) gives me a different menu
    depending on what screen I'm on, and to navigate to a certain screen
    may require several key presses and swipes through several other
    screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Uses in Education&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until models are released that don't require a cellular plan,
educational uses of Android are going to be limited. This year is going
to be interesting, but if you are currently researching which OS to use
in your classroom it would be hard to recommend Android until other
models are released. Android will have two big advantages over iOS
(which is going to be its biggest competitor in the upcoming year):
price and openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools rarely look at the total operating costs of equipment and
instead focus on purchase price. The Android tablets and handhelds will
be cheaper than their iOS cousins, and in some form factors will not
have competition (the 7 inch form factor such as the Nook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Openness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Android is Open Source, companies can release software to
automatically manage a fleet of devices. If you've been involved with
iOS app purchases, it requires several hoops to jump through, and then
it can't even automatically install the apps. This can change with
Android. Unfortunately, this will probably mean that any price savings
you received on the purchase of the devices will be eaten in the
management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Is it a contender?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Android is a contender in the mobile space. I believe that it is a
credible threat to the iPad/iPod Touch dominance we see in schools
today. Should you wait? No. If you are looking at implementing a mobile
device initiative then don't wait for Android devices. From an
educational point of view there isn't anything that can be done on one
that can't be done on the other. The Android app store seems to be
thriving, and as more devices are sold it will only entice more
developers. Mobile devices are set to overtake personal computers &lt;a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/08/11/the-great-game-mobile-devices-overtaking-pcs/"&gt;any
day now&lt;/a&gt; :-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What device do you use a majority of the time?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="android"></category><category term="cellphones"></category><category term="ios"></category><category term="mobile"></category></entry><entry><title>FIrst impressions of the MacBook Air 11"</title><link href="https://ryancollins.org/2010/10/27/first-impressions-of-the-macbook-air-11/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-10-27T11:23:00-04:00</published><updated>2010-10-27T11:23:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2010-10-27:/2010/10/27/first-impressions-of-the-macbook-air-11/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since Steve Jobs blessed my MacBook Air and I received it two day early,

I've had almost a week to investigate the 11" MacBook Air. I opted to
max it out, so it has 4GB of RAM, 128GB Solid State Drive (SSD) and the
1.6GHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU. The educational price was \$1,329, which
was almost more than I was willing to spend, but so far, it's been worth
it. The MBA is replacing an original 1.83GHz Intel Core Duo MacBook,
which had been upgraded to 2GB of RAM and a 7,200 RPM 200GB hard drive.
Before I ordered the MBA I did some quick calculations, and CPU wise,
the MBA should be as fast as my old MacBook (the Intel Core 2 Duo is
10-15% faster than the Intel Core Duo, and the MBA has a front bus of
800MHz compared to my MacBook's 667MHz). Adding more memory and the
faster drive, it is faster than the MacBook that replaced it.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the 11"?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing the 11" over the 13" Air models was an easy decision. My goal
was portability. Screen size doesn't really play into it, since at work
I have a 24" LCD and at home I have a 23" LCD. I was never very
impressed with the older 13" Air model. It was still the same size as my
MacBook, only thinner. If screen size does matter to you, I would think
long and hard before I would buy the 13" Air over a MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;Quick!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the machine, the quickness is very surprising. Of course, the SSD
gets most of the credit. When discussing the speed of the machine versus
other Macintosh models, a good analogy is in cars, electric cars versus
gas. Car motor power is measured by two different factors, horsepower
and torque. Horsepower is where you get your speed, and torque is how
fast you can get to your horsepower. Now an interesting thing happens
with electric cars versus gas. In a drag race, the electric car has the
advantage at the start since an electric motor has 100% of its torque
available at 0 RPMs, whereas a gasoline engine requires the motor to hit
a certain number of RPMs before torque is available. Depending on the
length of the race, an electric car can win every time against a more
powerful gasoline powered car. This is the same feeling with the MacBook
Air. With the SSD, the computer is faster than more powerful computers
for a wide range of tasks a user may do during the day. While a core i7
MacBook Pro is going to beat the MacBook Air at rendering video, if the
race is shorter, say launching Safari and browsing the web, the MacBook
Air is going to win. Can this machine be my main machine? It already is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Size wise, it is about as thick as my iPad (in the Apple Case) is, and
weight wise it's pretty much a tie with the iPad. In fact, I handed my
MBA and iPad to my sister-in-law and asked her which was heavier, and
she said the iPad! Although the MBA has about the same depth and
thickness as the iPad, it is around 1.5" longer. Not as portable as the
iPad, but pretty close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen size at first took a little getting used to. I wasn't too
worried about the smaller screen, but the first couple of days of using
it I kept wanting to bump up the font sizes when browsing. This need
went away, and I've now gotten used to the size of the fonts on the
screen. (By the way, when is a browser going to give me the ability to
double-click on an article and have it zoom into that text, like my iPad
and iPod Touch does?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Odds and ends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build quality is excellent, the full size keyboard is great, and the
touchpad is amazing. My extra MacBook charger works with it too! I
ordered mini-display port adapters for \$30 from &lt;a href="http://www.monoprice.com/"&gt;monoprice.com&lt;/a&gt; for
VGA, DVI, and HDMI. Compare that to the \$29 Apple wants for just the
VGA adapter! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ugly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually don't really have any cons against the MacBook Air 11". Twice
I've woken it up and the backlight didn't come on, but it hasn't
happened enough for me to worry about it yet (and I've got 11 more
months to decide whether to buy AppleCare for it :-). It's almost a
perfect travel companion, and if Apple could shave another inch or so
from the width it would be perfect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new MacBook Air is pretty much a given. The rumors are pretty
    strong that there will be an 11.6" and 13.3" Macbook Air, and that
    they'll be more affordable than the current Air. I'm hoping there is
    an 11.6" because I'm ready to upgrade my original MacBook! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New MacBook Pros. This is something I haven't read anywhere, but I'm
    pretty sure it's going to happen. Why? I ordered two for the school
     district on October 8th with a shipping time of 3-5 days. A week
    later I received a notification that they would ship between Oct.
    21-26. Notice the first day is the day after the Apple Event. And
    now today I received notification that they will not ship until Dec.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple must have something planned for the MacBook Pros, and
originally thought they would be able to ship them on the 21st, but
something happened and they're planning on shipping them 6 weeks
later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Mac App Store - Apple added the ability to sign applications in OS X
    10.5 Leopard, and with the success of the iOS App Store will create
    an App store for the Mac. Unfortunately it will still go through
    iTunes, because for some reason everything has to go through iTunes
    with Apple.&lt;/li&gt;

into 1st grade, I wanted to give her an outlet to publish online. What I
did was set up a Tumblr blog for her at &lt;a href="http://gracyl.ryancollins.org"&gt;gracyl.ryancollins.org&lt;/a&gt;. I
chose Tumblr because it allows her to easily post through email, so she
can post through her computer, my cellphone or her mom's cellphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of setting her up, I decided I wanted a more portable way
for her to write posts. I thought about giving her my 1G iPod Touch, but
went on eBay to look at the iPhone 3G (I wonder how you are supposed to
use the plural of iPhone 3G?). They seem to be selling for right around
\$150, so I bid on a couple and finally won one at \$138. I'm not
planning on activating cell service on it and will use it &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3406"&gt;just like an
iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt;. The advantage of the iPhone 3G of the iPod Touch is the
inclusion of the camera and GPS (I'm not certain the GPS works without
cell service, I guess I'll find out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Tumblr app installed, she will be able to post to her blog
anywhere she has wifi access. I'm excited to see how well it works, and
if she'll stay away from Tap Fish long enough to find out what else the
iPhone can do!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="dd"></category><category term="iPhone"></category><category term="iPod Touch"></category></entry><entry><title>Flowchart: Should you buy an iPad?</title><link href="https://ryancollins.org/2010/04/09/flowchart-should-you-buy-an-ipad/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-09T12:40:00-04:00</published><updated>2010-04-09T12:40:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2010-04-09:/2010/04/09/flowchart-should-you-buy-an-ipad/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I worked up a little flowchart in Pages on my iPad to help you make your

to focus on my experiences and how I've begun to use the iPad in my home
life and how it may be used in education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase:&lt;br&gt;
I reserved my ipad the day they opened reservations on line so I would
be guaranteed to pick one up on April 3rd. I didn't trust Saturday
delivery, so I headed to Columbus to the Easton Apple Store to stand in
the "privileged line", the one which had the others who had also
reserved their iPad. When we arrived at 7:30am, there were approximately
40 people in the reserved line and about twice that many in the
"unreserved" line, those that were hoping to still pick one up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I bought mine and while my brother and sister played with iPads
in the store, I pulled out my Macbook and setup my iPad. Some reviews
talk about the iPad ready for use right out of the box, but mine popped
up the "connect to iTunes" symbol. The initial sync didn't take long,
but I really wasn't syncing up too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial Impressions:&lt;br&gt;
Fast! It is probably the fastest browsing experience that I've ever
experienced. For the first time it was the speed of the network and not
the hardware slowing me down. The onscreen keyboard isn't that bad, I'm
typing this article on it, but it does take some getting used to. The
biggest problem is keeping your fingers up off the glass so it doesn't
register additional "key" presses. The other issue is that it is
practically impossible to type without looking at the keyboard, so if
you are typing in information that is on paper, it will be a lot slower.
Im debating whether to buy the bluetooth keyboard. I paired it with my
old Think Outside keyboard, which was a piece of cake, but that keyboard
is getting old and the k and l keys do not work the best. I also bought
the Apple case for it, which helps put the iPad at a good angle to use
or type on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer term impressions:&lt;br&gt;
There are more situations where a tablet can be used than a laptop, and
the additional screen space makes the iPad a lot more useful than the
iPod Touch. For example, at a meeting I can have the iPad in my lap or
on the table. Where the iPad shines is when I want to show others
information or something on the screen. I can just hold up the iPad or
hand it to them without the awkwardness one would experience with a
laptop. Maybe it's just the websites I visit, but lack of Flash has not
really been an issue. A lot of the video sites already support HTML 5,
which works flawlessly on the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been impressed with the number of iPad ready apps already in the
app store. Some of my favorite apps, such as Evernote, WordPress, and
iSSH are already available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educational implications:&lt;br&gt;
That being said about Flash above, students would notice the inability
to use some of there favorite sites. Sites such as Starfall, which would
be amazing on the iPad, fail from lack of Flash. The availability of
Pages and Keynote bring some productivity to the iPad, but the clumsy
method of using iTunes to transfer files would hinder their use in the
classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closing thoughts:&lt;br&gt;
I'm going to be posting more as I work with the device longer. I'm
excited to use it to teach a lesson in a kindergarten class to see how
well it will work as a teacher device. Some accessories will probably
end of purchasing include the camera connection kit and the Bluetooth
keyboard. The big unanswered question is "who is the iPad for?", and,
unfortunately I can't answer that yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="iPad"></category><category term="mobile"></category></entry><entry><title>The iPad has landed</title><link href="https://ryancollins.org/2010/04/03/the-ipad-has-landed/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-03T08:41:00-04:00</published><updated>2010-04-03T08:41:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2010-04-03:/2010/04/03/the-ipad-has-landed/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Braving almost 70? weather I arrived at the Easton Apple store at 7:40

update my status for either Ping.fm account I use the special email
addresses they offer and my email client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem was when I wanted to post the current page I'm reading to
either account. Ping.fm offers a bookmarklet, but it uses the current
logged in ping.fm account, so I would have to continually log in and log
out. I decided to put together my own bookmarklet that starts up a new
mail message in my default email client addressed to the correct Ping.fm
account. To get started, drag the following link to your bookmark bar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:window.location='mailto:YOURPRIVATEPINGADDRESS@ping.fm?body=is%20reading%20\&amp;quot;'+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'\&amp;quot;%20-%20('+encodeURIComponent(window.location)+')'"&gt;Ping.fm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once there, right click on the link, select edit and replace
&lt;strong&gt;YOURPRIVATEPINGADDRESS&lt;/strong&gt; with your private Ping.fm email address (just
the part to the left of the @). Would you like to do it with GMail? Drag
this link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:window.location='https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;tf=1&amp;amp;to=YOURPRIVATEPINGADDRESS@ping.fm&amp;amp;body=is%20reading%20\&amp;quot;'+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'\&amp;quot;%20-%20('+encodeURIComponent(window.location)+')'" title="GMail Ping.fm"&gt;Ping.fm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again, right click on the link, select edit, and replace
&lt;strong&gt;YOURPRIVATEPINGADDRESS&lt;/strong&gt; with your private Ping.fm email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can drag the links multiple times, editing the email address and the
name of the link so you can associate each one with a different Ping.fm
account.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="facebook"></category><category term="ping.fm"></category><category term="twitter"></category></entry><entry><title>Google Teacher Academy for Administrators Video</title><link href="https://ryancollins.org/2010/01/25/google-teacher-academy-for-administrators-video/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-01-25T21:51:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-01-25T21:51:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2010-01-25:/2010/01/25/google-teacher-academy-for-administrators-video/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've applied to attend the Google Teacher Academy for Administrators,

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I decided to expand my use of Twitter, and began
following more and more people in the education community. This was
awesome, until I realized I could not keep up with the barrage of data
that I was being given. In November I started brainstorming ideas on how
to keep up. I noticed in any of my twitter clients that they were not
grabbing all the tweets that had been posted from the last time I
checked. The reason being is the API only gives you the last 200 tweets,
and for me that was about 40 minutes worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first course of action was to write some software that would grab the
tweets from my [@mr_rcollins][] timeline, parse the info and store it
in a MySQL database. Besides pulling out the data I was interested in of
each tweet, I also stored the complete tweet. This became impractical,
since in a month the complete tweets themselves occupied 4.2GB! I
stopped storing the complete tweets which left me with a 20MB database
after a 5 weeks of collecting, which was a lot more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to start parsing the tweet's text for urls, resolve
any shortened urls, and dump them into another table for me to peruse.
While I got that software working, I came across &lt;a href="http://readtwit.com"&gt;ReadTwit.com&lt;/a&gt;. This
is a great service that will take your timeline, parse out the urls,
resolve shortened links, and give you a RSS feed that you can subscribe
to in your favorite RSS reader (I use &lt;a href="http://google.com/read"&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;. Now I just go
through Reader like normal, and am able to tag/star important sites that
are posted to my Twitter timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

also shouldn't single it out when talking about what skills it takes to
educate. The following list has a few items that are somewhat related to
technology, the others are what I view as important skills any teacher
needs to have if they want to succeed. Successful teachers will not find
any surprises in this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. mastery of your subject - If you don't know your subject, your
students will learn that rather quickly. You must know what you're
teaching, backwards and forwards. There are no shortcuts here. If you
cannot answer a student's question, use your searching skills to find
the answer as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. classroom management - Whether it's your morning math meeting or
working in small groups, you will not have a successful class if you
cannot manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Your students don't know as much as you think they do, and you know
more then they think you do - There are a few phrases that have gained
some popularity in the past couple of years that I disagree with. The
impression that teachers are digital immigrants and students are digital
natives is an incorrect assumption. Most students do not know as much as
their teachers when it comes to using technology. And teachers do know
more about technology then they realize. The personal computer is over
30 years old, for a majority of teachers this is longer then their
teaching career. They've seen how technology has changed some
classrooms, and can leverage that experience in their own classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4. Ability to punt - Your day to day classroom will probably never work
exactly as you pictured it in your mind, and your ability to punt and do
something different is imperative. Supplies for a science experiment
hasn't arrived? Prepare to punt. Internet access down? Punt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​5. Keeping an open mind - "&lt;em&gt;Those who say it can't be done, are usually
interrupted by someone doing it"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​6. Understand cheap, fast or easy, pick any two - This is a phrase I
use when talking to administrators when they wonder why something isn't
working the way they thought it should. The phrase basically means, you
can only two out of the three items. For example, if you want it cheap
and easy, it's not going to be fast. Or if you want it fast and easy, it
isn't going to be cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​7. Know how to search - Learn the shortcuts for how to include and
exclude search terms. Find out how to search for a particular filetype.
If you need a presentation on the water cycle, learn how to search for
one (with google use "filetype:ppt" as a search term).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​8. Embracing life-long learning - Anything you learn today will be out
of date before you retire. We don't have to sharpen our quills anymore,
or learn how to make dittos. Be prepared to learn every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​9. Creating a personal learning network - Seek out like minded teachers
as yourself. Email them, follow their blog, follow them on Twitter.
Create your own blog and Twitter account. Learn to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​10. Owning a home computer - I am totally surprised at the number of
teachers that do not own a home computer. The new netbooks are priced at
under \$400 and desktops around the same price, so price isn't much of
an obstacle. If you can't afford to buy, check out your local Freecycle
or Craigslist for people looking at getting rid of older computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything I missed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook has begun rolling out new settings for who can see your
Facebook profile and what they can see on your profile. I suggest you
double-check what is viewable about you. I try to keep my personal FB
totally separate from my &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/facebook"&gt;Facebook Page&lt;/a&gt;, so my profile is pretty much
locked down. Over at &lt;a href="http://www.labnol.org/"&gt;Digital Inspiration&lt;/a&gt; they've written an article

&lt;p&gt;Google has an obsession with speed. In fact, they have found that a .4
second delay in delivering search results causes a 30% drop in click
throughs. They started working on Chrome to deliver a browser that is
fast and secure. It also offers some other advatages such as isolating
each tab or window into separate processes. This means if a tab or
window crashes, it only affects that tab or window. Bookmarks can now be
synched with your Google account, and extensions are starting to become
available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my requirements for a browser is the ability to run multiple
profiles. I have one browser set for personal use and one set for
professional use (I do try to separate the two, although it is difficult

message on my &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/"&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://omnia.samsungmobile.com/"&gt;Samsung Omnia&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/default.mspx"&gt;Windows Mobile&lt;/a&gt;
cellphone). Sometimes it would be a message that I would need to act on,
but can't right at that moment. A lot of email clients allow you to flag
a message so you can remember to go back to it, but that's not an option
on my &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/"&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://omnia.samsungmobile.com/"&gt;Omnia&lt;/a&gt;. At first I'd just
mark the messages unread, but that also gets messy (not knowing if I
have new messages because of the unread indicator).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've done now is to create a folder called Flagged for each one of
my email accounts. Now when I get a message I need to act upon it later,
I'll move it to this Flagged folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I will just forward the message to my &lt;a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/"&gt;Remember the Milk&lt;/a&gt;
account, but that's a post for another day. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

open again. It is an online collaborative text editor usable by anyone
with an Internet connection, a browser, and Javascript. There is no sign
up required, you just share a unique URL with the people you want to
collaborate with. Each user is color coded and there is a chat box. You
can use the random URL assigned or make one up just by appending the
name of the document to the end of the url:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;http://etherpad.com/NAMEOFDOCUMENT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It has a couple of advantages of using the word processing aspect of
Google Docs. For starters, it's dead simple to get people involved just
by sharing the url. It is also realtime, you see the edits of the other
people as they make them. There is also a chat box to discuss changes as
you make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also offer a private hosted version, but there isn't any pricing
available on the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some school districts will be wary of using a product that
would allow their students to chat throughout the district, I think the
advantages would outweigh these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uses in the school include after hour editing assistance, a student
could send the link to a document they're working on to their teacher,
and both can work on the document. Also, any group projects could use it
for notes, planning, todo lists, etc., available to all the members of
the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At almost \$500 I don't see it as either. The biggest negative about the
Kindle will also be the last thing fixed, if it is ever addressed, and
that is the ability to re-sell your content (or at least lend it to
others). I'm sure the textbook companies are falling over themselves to
support the Kindle. Here is the ability to sell a text book, with no
production/delivery costs, and then know that the book will not be
resold at the end of the semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper subscription idea has merit, but then again, they need to
lower their subscription rates. I've looked at transferring my USA Today
subscription to digital, but it costs almost the same as getting a paper
copy! At least with the paper copy I can lend/give it to someone else,
or cut out an article to save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is anyone looking at using the Kindle in a school? What would be the
advantages of it over something like a netbook?&lt;/p&gt;

in OS X like Safari, Omniweb, etc. I didn't bother trying to figure out
the problem, until today when I would go to a site in Safari and it
would ask to save the password. I said yes everytime, but it still
didn't save it. Finally I tracked down this blog post, &lt;a href="http://blog.davidohara.net/2007/12/19/os-x-keychain-not-saving-passwords/"&gt;OS X Keychain
Not Saving Passwords…&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggled with this one for about a month before I finally dug into
what was wrong and how to fix it. It all started when I reinstalled
because I couldn’t get BootCamp installed because of volume
fragmentation. Since then, my applications, specifically Mail.app and
Adium, weren’t remembering passwords even if I checked the little
“remember” box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, for some reason, the keychain file at
\~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain was now owned by root instead of by
me. To check and fix from the commandline (&lt;strong&gt;\$&lt;/strong&gt; is the command
prompt):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ls -l ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain -rw-r--r--  1 ryan  admin  781380 Apr  8 11:17 (*deleted...*)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My username is &lt;strong&gt;ryan&lt;/strong&gt;. If it says anything else, use the following to
change the ownership:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ sudo chown ryan ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It will ask for the administrator password, and then change the
ownership of the file. I don't think repair permissions in Disk Utility
would fix this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

education community and some of my pet peeves. My biggest complaint with
education vendors is the lack of pricing transparency. If I'm going to
take the time to visit your website and examine your product, the least
you can do is put some pricing information on your website. For example,
if I'm looking at using a student response system with wireless products
such as Wifi Palms and iPod Touches, I could visit &lt;a href="http://www.polleverywhere.com/"&gt;PollAnywhere.com&lt;/a&gt;,
click on &lt;a href="http://www.polleverywhere.com/plans/retail"&gt;Pricing&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href="http://www.polleverywhere.com/plans/classroom_response_system_k12"&gt;K12&lt;/a&gt; and know exactly how much the
product will cost me. Now I still need to research other solutions, so
let's visit &lt;a href="http://www.turningtechnologies.com/"&gt;Turningpoint.com&lt;/a&gt;. Cool, right in the middle of the front
page they have the &lt;a href="http://www.turningtechnologies.com/interactiveaudienceresponseproducts/responsewareweb.cfm"&gt;product&lt;/a&gt; I want to learn about. Let's see how much
this costs.... ummm... Nothing. I can contact sales, but that's about
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vendors, if you don't list prices, I view that as your solution must be
too expensive for my school district. I'm pressed enough for time, I
don't want to jump through hoops to see if your product is something
that we can use.&lt;/p&gt;

started looking at alternative top level domain names, and settled on
&lt;a href="http://kcs.me/"&gt;kcs.me&lt;/a&gt;. Now you can go to &lt;a href="http://kcs.me/"&gt;http://kcs.me/&lt;/a&gt; and it will
automatically redirect to our main page. I haven't started integrating
it into to many other services, but I do plan on setting up our email
accounts so you can use @kcs.me for any current address and it will
work. We also have a custom 404 error page that let's us setup keywords
as shortcuts to commonly used web pages on our website, such as the
user's personal portal page (their MyCatPage, &lt;a href="http://kcs.me/my"&gt;kcs.me/my&lt;/a&gt;) and staff
home pages (&lt;a href="http://kcs.me/collinsr"&gt;kcs.me/collinsr&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

name I created the first item as a text field in which they would enter
their name (and Google makes this easy for you since that's what the
first item defaults to. I did set it to be a required field though. For
the class list I used a dropdown field. Each choice I labeled with the
date of the class, the class title, and the time of the class. I didn't
go into great depths like a description of the class since that is
emailed to the staff and available on the Technology Staff Development
site in Moodle. Now the staff can easily sign up for classes, I can
quickly find out how many people are in each class, and I can remove the
class when the sign up deadline is past or when the class is full. The
spreadsheet can also be used to take attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

Conference&lt;/a&gt; we should be able to use &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/twitterbotphp.zip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to communicate
great things that individuals see throughout the conference. It needed
to be set up easy enough for people that have not been using Twitter to
use. After discussions with John Schinker, they contacted me and I came
up with the idea of a twitter bot that people would follow, and direct
messages to that bot would be sent to all the bot's followers. This way
most people can just follow the bot and get updates, and those that
wanted to send out an update would only need to send a direct message to
the bot with the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the bot works is off of the emails that Twitter sends out when a
Twitter account receives a notification of a new follower or a direct
message. The requirements for the bot are:&lt;br&gt;
• A twitter account (in this case it is etechohio09)&lt;br&gt;
• An email account with POP3 access (in this case a gmail account is
used. This email account address needs to be secret because there isn't
any checking on the validity of where an email came from so this would
allow people without even a Twitter account to spam the bot)&lt;br&gt;
• a unix based host with php at the command line (I use Ubuntu, but it
should work in OS X)&lt;br&gt;
• fetchmail also needs to be available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process to set up the bot is as follows:&lt;br&gt;
1. An email account is set up at gmail. This account must of pop3
turned on, which you can do from the gmail settings.&lt;br&gt;
2. Create a Twitter account, using the above email account. In Twitter
be sure to go to Settings -&gt; Notices and have the notices for followers
and direct messages checked.&lt;br&gt;
3. Set up an account on the unix host for the bot.&lt;br&gt;
4. Login to the account on the unix host.&lt;br&gt;
5. Create the .fetchmailrc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     nano -w .fetchmailrc
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​6. Enter the following lines to that file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     set logfile /home/UNIXACCOUNT/fetchmail.log

     poll &amp;quot;pop.gmail.com&amp;quot; proto POP3 timeout 100 no uidl
     no envelope user &amp;quot;BOTACCOUNT@gmail.com&amp;quot;
     password &amp;quot;BOTPASSWORD&amp;quot; fetchlimit 100 ssl
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​7. Create the logfile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     touch fetchmail.log
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​8. Create the .forward file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     nano -w .forward
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​9. Enter the following line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     |&amp;quot;/home/UNIXACCOUNT/twitterbot.php&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​10. Download [twitterbot.php][], and make it executable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     chmod +x twitterbot.php
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​11. Edit twitterbot.php and enter your Twitter username and password:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     nano twitterbot.php
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​12. Start up fetchmail in daemon mode and your bot should be
functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     fetchmail -d 60
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What will happen is that fetchmail will check the email account every 60
seconds. Any email will be downloaded and each message passed to
twitterbot.php. twitterbot.php will examing the headers for the twitter
command and then act accordingly. If it is a new follower, twitterbot
will start following that person. If it is a direct message, twitterbot
will then post that message to the bot's timeline for all its followers
to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email class used for this twitterbot came from &lt;a href="http://phpclasses.elib.com/browse/file/8922.html"&gt;phpclasses.org&lt;/a&gt;,
modified to pull out a few of the X-headers that Twitter adds so the bot
can figure out the type of message and who is sending it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="email"></category><category term="etech"></category><category term="php"></category><category term="twitter"></category></entry><entry><title>Teacher covers copy costs with ads</title><link href="https://ryancollins.org/2008/12/02/teacher-covers-copy-costs-with-ads/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-12-02T14:11:00-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-02T14:11:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2008-12-02:/2008/12/02/teacher-covers-copy-costs-with-ads/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2008-12-01-test-ads_N.htm?csp=34"&gt;Ads on tests add up for teacher - USATODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting way to deal with cost cutting, but I don't know the
sustainability of the model. Right now the ads are pretty tame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two-thirds of Farber's ads are inspirational messages
underwritten by parents. Others are ads for local businesses, such as
two from a structural engineering firm and one from a dentist who
urges students, "Brace Yourself for a Great Semester!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have sponsorships in the schools with &lt;a href="http://pepsi.com/"&gt;Pepsi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.coca-cola.com/"&gt;Coke&lt;/a&gt;
vying for exclusivity contracts, but once teachers start advertising,
where does it end? Is there oversight of his ads? What happens and a
religious organization wants to advertise?&lt;/p&gt;

to educational technology, software, and hardware. After some
reflection, I realized that it would make a good series of articles, so
I'm going to write up &lt;strong&gt;How I Work&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is probably the most important component of my technology
arsenal, my &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP31"&gt;Apple MacBook&lt;/a&gt;. During the spring of 2006 I was
researching upgrading my &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/support/imac/g4/"&gt;17" iMac&lt;/a&gt; to a new &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro/"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The plan
was to buy a beefy enough MacBook Pro that I wouldn't want to upgrade
for awhile. I specc'ed out the MacBook Pro that I wanted to be almost
\$2,500! I wasn't happy being stuck with getting such a large laptop,
but I was in luck that Apple then announced the &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP31"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt;. After realizing I could buy a MacBook and an iMac for the same
price as the MacBook Pro, I ordered my &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP31"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt;. After
using it, I realized I didn't even need a desktop at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP31"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/"&gt;VMware Fusion&lt;/a&gt;, I get the best
of all worlds. I run OS X 10.5 mainly, but have a &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/default.mspx"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; virtual machines also installed on the machine. Since the
original purchase I've bumped the memory from 1GB to 2GB and the hard
drive from 80GB to 200GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, come summer 2009 when I'll be looking at upgrading I
don't know what I'll do. The new MacBook's lack of firewire is almost a
deal killer for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am at home I hook my &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP31"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt; up to a 17" LCD
monitor and use a cheap [\$30 Micro Innovations wireless keyboard and
mouse I purchased from Wal-mart][] (mine is a dark grey, not the hideous
color from the picture). The combo works pretty well, except sometimes I
have to unplug and re-plug the USB dongle that works with the set when I
wake the MacBook up from sleep. That's also where I keep an external
hard drive to maintain my laptops backups using OS X's &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html"&gt;Time Machine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; A new law that takes effect next fall requires every district in the
&gt; state to set up an online school for kindergarten through eighth-grade
&gt; students.
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fascinating to me, and I'm surprised that this didn't get more
news coverage when the legislation was being passed in Florida. Each
district still gets the \$6,000 per student, and most are going to buy
the services of a couple of companies that provide online education
instead of create their own online curriculum. Even the computer and
Internet connection are provided to the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see this being a watershed moment in the aspect of educational
technology. Can education be provided digitally and will students learn
just as well as they do in a classroom of 20 students? The pitfalls are
enormous, mostly centering around socialization skills, although this
should be a solved problem with the years of home schooling that have
taken place. [In the spring of 2003, 1,096,000 students were being home
schooled in the United States][].&lt;/p&gt;

According to a recent study, [names really do make a difference][]:

&gt; Parents are being warned to think long and hard when choosing names
&gt; for their babies as research has discovered that girls who are given
&gt; very feminine names, such as Anna, Emma or Elizabeth, are less likely
&gt; to study maths or physics after the age of 16, a remarkable study has

&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fascinating research. They even examined twin girls and found that what
they were named could put them on two entirely different career paths.
Also, naming a child with a 'lower-status' name, spelled in an unusual
way or including punctuation, lowered exam scores by 3-5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing for new parents to worry about. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Happy 35th Birthday Ethernet</title><link href="https://ryancollins.org/2008/05/24/happy-35th-birthday-ethernet/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-05-24T08:59:00-04:00</published><updated>2008-05-24T08:59:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2008-05-24:/2008/05/24/happy-35th-birthday-ethernet/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div style&gt;

[![][]][]On the Ohio Technology Coordinator's listserv this question was
posted:

&gt; We already had one case of student to teacher generated e-mail that
&gt; originated on a student computer inside the school. The FIRST question
&gt; I got as the Tech Director was 'Why are you allowing students to send
&gt; and receive email in school?'
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my question would be, "Why are you letting them use pencil and
paper? They could be sending notes to other students or staff!". For
discipline we do not distinguish between computer generated or person
generated correspondence. The punishment may change if it's on the
computer because they'd lose computer privileges due to the AUP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're not going to be able to stop it. A student could simply fire up
&lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/wp/2008/04/08/sysk-test-your-smtp-mail-server-with-telnet/"&gt;telnet and use your existing mail server to send email&lt;/a&gt; to whoever
they want, saying anything they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No access to telnet on the machine? Then throw up a Java telnet client
on any old web host and access it from there. Actually, if I wanted to
get around a school's filters, this is the route I'd probably go. Once I
get SSH somewhere, I can get full access to the Internet, and it only
requires port 80, a web browser, and Java. (This is what I use at places
that have network access locked down. I open a SSH tunnel over port 443
to my home computer, and then have full access to anything on the
Internet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is email use part of the State of Ohio Technology Standards, it
is our job as teachers to educate the students on the proper use of
email. How to use it, what's appropriate, etc. Part of the problem with
the garbage that students send through email is that they've never seen
anything else. It's pretty foreign for them to see an email message with
proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation. (I hope I have everything
correct in this post! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet you have students right now using a free email services, ssh
tunnels, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like to think we have things locked down, but unless you're working
for the NSA, you do not have it locked down. Education of the students,
punishment for inappropriate behavior is a good way to go. We as
Technology Coordinators we have a habit of putting up technological road
blocks instead of solving the real problems.&lt;/p&gt;

11-year-old student named Jon Penn stepped in as network manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reflection I realized that this story is a big reason why IT
departments are looked down upon as less than professional in
organizations school districts today. For example, replace "network
manager" with "1st grade teacher". Would this student receive accolades
or would the district be singled out as harming the educational
experience of their first graders? What would fellow teachers think of
an 11 year old attempting to do their job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for IT people, if you're doing your job well, it appears
that you're not doing anything at all. Everything just works and people
question why you are getting paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Articles like the above do not help promote the professionalism of IT.
Your boss, upon reading that article, could believe that they could just
hire people off the streets and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As IT professionals, we need to promote and market ourselves, separate
the wheat from the chaff. Anyone can install an Internet appliance, but
it takes a little more knowledge and experience to run the IT department
of a school district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. I don't want to belittle Jon Penn's accomplishments, I wish I
would've had the opportunity at his age.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

necessary to see what the email server is spitting out, just to make
sure everything is working. The easiest way to do that is to use the
&lt;strong&gt;telnet&lt;/strong&gt; command. Telnet allows you to connect to various services on
remote or local machines through the command line. Today we are going to
be using it to send some email. You'll first need to bring up the
command-line on your respective operating system. First see if telnet is
installed. Type:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And you should see something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Welcome to Microsoft Telnet Client&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Escape Character is 'CTRL+]'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Microsoft Telnet&amp;gt;?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Or this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;telnet&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since that works, type &lt;strong&gt;quit&lt;/strong&gt; to exit telnet. Next, we need to open a
connection to our mail server. We will need to know the name or ip
address of the mail server:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;telnet mail.example.com 25&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(The 25 is the port number that SMTP runs on.) You should then get a
response back from your mail server:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Trying 10.0.0.18... Connected to mail.example.com. Escape character is '^]'. 220 mail.example.com ESMTP Postfix&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The server is now waiting for a command. We need to say Hello. &lt;em&gt;(* For
the remaining examples I'm going to use the domain example.com. You'll
need to replace that with your local domain name. *)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;helo example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Which returns:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;250 mail.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The mail server now needs to know who is sending the email:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mail from: myname@example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Returns:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;250 Ok&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Who are you sending the mail to?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;rcpt to: recipient@example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Returns:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;250 Ok&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now it is time to tell it the message:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Returns:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;354 End data with .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Enter your message:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Subject: test message This is a test message .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To end the message, you need to put a period at the beginning of the
line and hit the return key. Now your message is on its way!&lt;br&gt;
Now type quit to exit&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;quit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic"&gt;Yes I will lead&lt;/span&gt;. The new
category is called Skills You Should Know - SYSK. Little bits of
information that through my experience aren't something that you may not
necessarily use every day, but may someday save you a ton of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's topic is &lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;vi&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Vi&lt;/span&gt; may be the only editor
installed on a new unix based system, and a few commands will get you to
the point where at least you can edit a few files before installing
something a little more user friendly such as pico (or nano).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vi has two modes, command and insertion. It was designed this way
because sometimes the keyboard you would be using might not necessarily
have all the keys we take for granted today, especially when it comes to
the arrow keys. In command mode you can move the cursor around with the
arrow keys or hjkl keys. To do an editing, you'll need to switch to
insertion mode. Vi defaults to command mode when it is started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; - Switches to insertion mode&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;\&lt;ESC\&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - Switches to command
mode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, you'll start the editor with a file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vi somefile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the file is open, you'll press
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; to switch to insertion mode.
Make the changes to your file. Press
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;\&lt;ESC\&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to switch back to command
mode. To exit you'll press the following (these all start with the
colon):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;:wq&lt;/span&gt; - Write the file and then
quit&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;:q!&lt;/span&gt; - Quit the file without
saving the changes. A great way if you mess up and just want to not save
your changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These preceding commands should at least get you started. For more info,

&lt;p&gt;I found one company that already is thinking this way, &lt;a href="http://www.quizzlerpro.com/"&gt;Pocket Mobility
with their Quizzler Pro&lt;/a&gt; product. Me on the other hand, loves the
challenge of coding something up myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone worked with ISRSs? What did you like? What didn't you like?
Is this something I should look at as a summer project? :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 20-minute burst of the 'brain training' exercises on Nintendo's DS
console at the start of the day apparently improves performance in
maths tests by as much as 10 per cent, according to a Scottish study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the completed 10 week study certainly are fascinating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a maths test at the end of the trial, their performance improved by
an average 10 per cent, and the time to complete the test also dropped
from 17 minutes to 13 minutes and nine seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty impressive results, although I don't know what game they're
talking about, unless it happens to be &lt;em&gt;Brain Age 2&lt;/em&gt;. Checking Amazon UK
shows a DS game called &lt;em&gt;More Brain Traing&lt;/em&gt;, which may just be a relabel
&lt;em&gt;Brain Age 2&lt;/em&gt;. I guess I'll have to do some more checking. What a solid
return on your investment though. It would cost a class of 25 \$3,750 to
outfit the entire class with a DS. Throw in the DS Browser and you have
even more ways to integrate it into your classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long until a company comes out with a mobile version of Brain Age 2
that you can play from any mobile computing device?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 25, the U.S. Patent &amp;amp; Trademark Office issued its Non-Final
Action on the re-examination of the Blackboard Patent. We are studying
the document, found here, but in short, the PTO has rejected all 44 of
Blackboard's claims. We caution that this is a NON-final action; both
Blackboard and Desire2Learn will have an opportunity to comment before
a final action will issue, and after that, the decision will be
subject to appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good news, especially not only for Desire2Learn, but also users
of all online coursework delivery systems. Although I'm torn on the idea
of software patents, the ones awarded to Blackboard in my opinion did
not pass the obviousness test. Blackboard has gone on record that they
were not going to go after open source implementations like Moodle, but
I can't help to think that just the idea that Blackboard could sue would
put a damper on some new Moodle installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the technology world it seems we're continually confronted with new
products, services, software, hardware, etc. And for those of us who
have a tough time focusing on one thing at a time, this dizzying array
of choices can easily distract us or keep us from finishing previous
tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/0060005688"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Barry Schwartz it
describes why this is a problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We normally assume in America that more options ("easy fit" or
"relaxed fit"?) will make us happier, but Schwartz shows the opposite
is true, arguing that having all these choices actually goes so far as
to erode our psychological well-being."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a technology coordinator, I'm constantly trying out new things, and
it's very hard to decide whether to actually implement something. Will
this new product be easy enough for staff and students to use? Is the
learning curve mild enough that my users will learn this product and use
it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you ask others in the educational technology community what's the
best wiki, blogging software, operating system, etc. you'll get a ton of
choices. So many choices may ultimately lead you to either never be
satisfied with your final choice, or worse, never make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog I am going to try to only give one or two choices for
solutions to specific problems. They may not be the best choice, but in
the long run, they will be good enough to be of use (I hope).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We already had it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't need anything that fancy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also had FMP Server and FMP Unlimited (version 5.5) so I could
    easily publish the database onto the web, that way it can be updated
    from anywhere with a web connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a big fan of using barcodes on our equipment. Our asset tag
numbers are only 5 digits long, it doesn't take time at all to easily
type them. We do use a barcode reader when inventorying new equipment.
It cuts down on errors when entering serial numbers or MAC addresses.
The barcode reader can read the barcodes right off of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enter new equipment, we use a spreadsheet. Once the spreadsheet is
filled out, it is imported into the FMP database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't track help desk requests along with hardware. We have
approximately 700 machines, and it's very rare that a piece of equipment
will have one hardware failure, let alone multiple failures that need to
be tracked.&lt;/p&gt;

but others should have more common appeal (imaging machings). There are
conversations that happen on the Technology Coordinator's listserv that

&lt;a href="http://glossymolenet.wordpress.com/"&gt;Glossy - MoLeNet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Glossy project will undertake a large-scale development and
implementation of mobile learning across Gloucestershire College
utilising the mobile devices that learners already own. A comparative
study will be made by providing a range of mobile devices for learners
in excluded groups at Gloucestershire College and learners with learning
difficulties and disabilities at National Star College. The project will
put in place an infrastructure that will allow learners using devices
which they already own to access learning activities and content through
a mobile learning portal in conjunction with the college VLE."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very interesting project, to utilize mobile devices that
students already have. I plan on following their blog and am very
interested in their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...which is how in god’s name can we talk seriously about 21st Century
skills for kids if we’re not talking 21st Century skills for educators
first? The more I listened, the less I heard in terms of how we make
the teaching profession as a whole even capable of teaching these
“skills” to kids. Sure, there were mentions of upgrading teacher
preparation programs and giving teachers additional time in the school
day to collaborate, etc. But the URGENCY was all around the kids.
Shouldn’t the URGENCY be all about the teachers right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am absolutely shocked at the lack of technology use by
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;teachers&lt;/span&gt; and
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;technology coordinators&lt;/span&gt;. I've
been to several technology coordinator meetings, there will usually be
30 or 40 tech coordinators in the room, and as I scan the audience,
there are only a handful taking notes into their computer. Most are
writing on yellow legal pads! Maybe I'm using technology for
technology's sake, but I respectfully disagree in this example. By
putting my notes in electronic format I'm already going to be able to
easily file and more importantly find this information at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extends to the eTech Ohio Conference this past February. It seems
that most &lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;teachers&lt;/span&gt; and
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;technology staff&lt;/span&gt;, while promoting
the virtues of technology integration, don't use it themselves. When you
start mentioning RSS, Twitter, Wikis, a lot don't have any clue what
you're talking about. At least most know what blogging is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the solution? &lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Teachers&lt;/span&gt;
need to be shown how, at the very least, technology can save them time.
If technology can save a teacher 10 minutes a day, that 1,830 minutes of
the course of the school year, or 30.5 hours. Even if they need a 4 hour
training on how to save those ten minutes, they still come out ahead! I
believe that once they see that the computer is supposed to save them
time as opposed to taking more time, it will ease further staff
development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Technology Coordinators&lt;/span&gt;, you need
to be guiding the administrators and teachers in your district. If you
don't use technology, then there is less incentive for anyone else to
use it. Automate repetitive tasks. Use RSS. Setup a blog. Subscribe to a
podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;You need to lead.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

but that is getting harder to do. Technology in education has become
such a commodity that the break throughs are getting more and more
uncommon. I'm also torn with the problem of too many choices. It's hard

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the film, movie-watchers influence one another and
gradually synchronize their emotional responses. This mutual mimicry
also affects each participant's evaluation of the overall experience
-- the more in sync we are with the people around us, the more we like
the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can this research be applied to the classroom? We've all taught at least
one lesson where it seems like everything clicked. The students were
engaged, on task, and excited. Even the most prepared teacher can have a
lesson go south, but it appears that a lesson might be saved by
"groupthink". By slowly bringing the class on task, it can cause a
snowball effect, not only increasing the enjoyment of the students but
also increasing their retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm reminded of this &lt;a href="http://www.edsupport.cc/mguhlin/archives/2007/12/entry_4005.htm" title="Around the Corner - MGuhlin.net : From the Archives: Fire Them"&gt;post by Miguel Guhlin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my early years of working with adult learners, I facilitated a
workshop that was everyone's nightmare class--a cafeteria technology
inservice. In the morning, provide inspiring words about using
technology. In the afternoon, hands-on tutorial. The morning went well
since we had cooperative grouping, activities, etc. The afternoon was
focused on how-to, but I had some physical education coaches that
whipped out newspapers. I was supremely irritated and felt powerless.
It was my first solo workshop for the Education Service Center, and I
wasn't sure what to do...if I'd been working as a school district
facilitator, I know exactly what I would have done--I'd asked them to
leave. Instead, I put up with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a teacher can't "fire" their students, a teacher needs to be
aware of the negative influence those off-task students are having on
the rest of the class.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Headlines"></category></entry><entry><title>Camtasia Studio for free</title><link href="https://ryancollins.org/2007/11/26/camtasia-studio-for-free/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-11-26T11:53:00-05:00</published><updated>2007-11-26T11:53:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2007-11-26:/2007/11/26/camtasia-studio-for-free/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.edsupport.cc/mguhlin/archives/2007/11/entry_3928.htm"&gt;Miguel Guhlin&lt;/a&gt; who got it from &lt;a href="http://mlearning.edublogs.org/2007/11/23/free-camtasia-studio-313/"&gt;Leonard at the Mobile Learning

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are your meetings worth every penny? Find out with the new Meeting
Miser. Just enter the attendees and start the timer. This handy gadget
knows that time is money and will calculate exactly how much you're
spending ... or wasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site uses actual salary info for your area to calculate the cost per
meeting. I tried it with a typical scenario, 3 elementary teachers and a
principal meeting. The cost came to \$1.41 a minute, or \$84.60 an hour.
An administrator meeting with 4 principals and the superintendent jumps
up to \$2.84 a minute (\$170.40 an hour!). Might be something to bring
up the next time you are sitting in a meeting that isn't accomplishing
anything.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Headlines"></category></entry><entry><title>Websites to create newsletters, brochures, albums, and cards</title><link href="https://ryancollins.org/2007/09/21/websites-to-create-newsletters-brochures-albums-and-cards/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-09-21T08:52:00-04:00</published><updated>2007-09-21T08:52:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2007-09-21:/2007/09/21/websites-to-create-newsletters-brochures-albums-and-cards/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the NCS-Tech blog: &lt;a href="http://www.ncs-tech.org/?p=928#comment-23850"&gt;Meet your “Maker” - Newsletters, Brochures,

&lt;p&gt;Our culture is obsessed with being busy. When’s the last time you
asked someone about their job or life and they didn’t use the word
busy? It’s worn like a badge of honor. To even hint you might not be
busy, conjures up visions of laziness and lack of ambition. As we plan
various activities and events for schools, I’ll often hear, “that’s a
busy time for schools”. Tell me when it’s not a busy time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google recognizes the central role that teachers play in breaking down
the barriers between people and information, and we support educators
who work each day to empower their students and expand the frontiers
of human knowledge. This website is one of the ways we're working to
bolster that support and explore how Google and educators can work
together.As a start, we're inviting you to share your best ideas for
using technology to innovate in the classroom. To your left, you'll
find a teacher's guide to 12 Google products, including basic
information about each tool, examples of how educators are using them,
and lesson ideas. You'll also find lesson plans and videos from our
partners at Discovery Education focusing on two of our most popular
teaching tools: Google Earth and Google SketchUp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first read it I was expecting a more general view of Internet&lt;br&gt;
resources that may be used in the classroom, but limiting it to Google
products still gives teachers and students some very cool software they
can use. Google Earth is talked about a lot, but I think a lot of people
are missing out learning opportunities that can take place with &lt;a href="http://sketchup.google.com/"&gt;Google
SketchUp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;cite&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what are the features of Star Trek that a person interested in
science can enjoy without guilt, and what features rightly tick off
those persnickety critics? Well, many of the star systems mentioned on
the show, such as Wolf 359, really do exist. Usually, though, the
writers just make them up! There have also been some beautiful special
effects pictures of binary stars and solar flares which were
astronomically accurate and instructive. The best accuracy and worst
stumbles can be found among the features of the show that have becom e
constant through all of the episodes. Here's a list of the standard
Star Trek features, roughly in order of increasing scientific
incredibility:&lt;/p&gt;

Asset for Schools&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of blindly following what's in Wikipedia,
use it to present "teachers with an excellent authentic learning
activity in which students can demonstrate their skills as scholars":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]Take a group of fifth grade students and break them into groups,
with each group picking a topic that interests them. Any topic.
Dolphins, horses, hockey, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, send the groups of kids to Wikipedia to look up the topic they
selected. [...] The horse, for example, has an extensive entry on the
website. It certainly looks accurate and informative, but is it?
Unfortunately, there are no citations for any of the facts claimed
about horses on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]The group of students breaks down the content on the page into
manageable chunks, each with a certain amount of facts that need to be
verified. The students then spend the necessary time to fact-check the
content.&lt;br&gt;
 Once the Wikipedia entry has been fact-checked, the teacher creates a
Wikipedia login for the class. They go to the entry's talk page and
present their findings, laying out every idea that needs to be
corrected. Then, they edit the actual entry to make the corrections,
with all sources cited. Similarly, for all the parts of the entry
they've verified as accurate, they list sources confirming it.&lt;/p&gt;
