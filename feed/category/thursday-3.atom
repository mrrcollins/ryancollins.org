&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.educationrethink.com/2013/06/the-problem-with-should.html"&gt;Jon Spencer&lt;/a&gt; lays out the problems with using &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, the problem with "should" is that it places all of teaching into rigid, binary, either/or, right/wrong boxes. It takes away the individuality, the autonomy, the creativity and the contextual knowledge required to teach well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why you SHOULD stop saying SHOULD&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ptpamedia.com/blog/index.php/2013/01/08/why-you-should-stop-saying-should/"&gt;Julia Suppa&lt;/a&gt; lists &lt;em&gt;Why you SHOULD stop saying SHOULD&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get my point. Should is really a useless word – it implies that there’s a better way to do something, and you’re not doing it. It also places blame – either on yourself or on someone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why You Should Stop Saying ‘Should’&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://befriendingyourbody.com/why-you-should-stop-saying-should/"&gt;Why You Should Stop Saying ‘Should’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It puts the focus on what you’re not doing instead of all the things you are doing. Not recognizing your successes and achievements keeps you on quest to fulfill impossible standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://johnaugust.com/2013/writing-vs-speaking"&gt;John August&lt;/a&gt; brings us a TED talk by &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/UmvOgW6iV2s"&gt;John McWhorter&lt;/a&gt; titled &lt;strong&gt;Txtng is killing language.

&lt;p&gt;First up is an impassioned teacher's resignation video. Her speech won't be a revelation for teachers. I'm posting it for those out there who feel the same way, &lt;strong&gt;You're not alone&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One fascinating aspect of watching this on Youtube is the number of &lt;em&gt;I quit&lt;/em&gt; videos from other teachers listed in the &lt;strong&gt;What's related&lt;/strong&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

This isn't your everyday weather site. A couple of things make it unique. On the main website there is a time machine button, which allows you to look at what the weather was in the past. The other neat feature is that if you visit it from an iOS device, it asks you to install it as an HTML5 app. Nice, functional and free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An oldie but a goodie, &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/dashboard"&gt;If This Then That - IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; lets you automate web services. For example, I use the Pocket read it later service.

&lt;p&gt;One of the main cornerstones of education is sharing. What one teacher
or student creates is freely shared with others, for the benefits of the
system. Unfortunately, Prince George is currently review a policy that
would assign all work completed by teachers and students to the
district. From what I understand about copyright, teacher work could
conceivably fall under &lt;em&gt;work for hire&lt;/em&gt;, which means the school district
could assert this ownership. But should they? For students the legality
is a bit murky. Since the students do not work for the district, it
would be a stretch to believe that the district could assert copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://stevekeating.me/2013/02/04/why-bosses-are-poor-leaders/"&gt;Why “Bosses” are Poor Leaders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bosses are a dime a dozen. Leaders can be one in a million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of another quote I've read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do things for your boss because you have to, you do things for a
leader because you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I was
extremely lucky and grateful for a chance to attend last year, and
attend isn't quite the right word to use. A better word would be
&lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is EduCon?&lt;br /&gt;
 EduCon is both a conversation and a conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an innovation conference where we can come together, both in
person and virtually, to discuss the future of schools. Every session
will be an opportunity to discuss and debate ideas — from the very
practical to the big dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Videos of Educon sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/educon204"&gt;All of the sessions are available to watch on Youtube!&lt;/a&gt;. Try not to
be overwhelmed by the number of videos, just take one a day/week/month.
A great resource for an edchat in your school district and a glimpse
into how learning takes place in other schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Preaching to the #educhoir Really DOES Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written about the &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/2011/11/30/beware-of-the-echo-chamber/"&gt;echo chamber&lt;/a&gt; before and the perils therein,
but Bill Ferriter writes how sometimes &lt;a href="http://teacherleaders.typepad.com/the_tempered_radical/2013/01/preaching-to-the-educhoir-matters.html"&gt;you need the echo chamber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple truth is that being a change agent can be a REALLY lonely
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
