&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.educationrethink.com/2013/06/the-problem-with-should.html"&gt;Jon Spencer&lt;/a&gt; lays out the problems with using &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, the problem with "should" is that it places all of teaching into rigid, binary, either/or, right/wrong boxes. It takes away the individuality, the autonomy, the creativity and the contextual knowledge required to teach well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why you SHOULD stop saying SHOULD&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ptpamedia.com/blog/index.php/2013/01/08/why-you-should-stop-saying-should/"&gt;Julia Suppa&lt;/a&gt; lists &lt;em&gt;Why you SHOULD stop saying SHOULD&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get my point. Should is really a useless word – it implies that there’s a better way to do something, and you’re not doing it. It also places blame – either on yourself or on someone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why You Should Stop Saying ‘Should’&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://befriendingyourbody.com/why-you-should-stop-saying-should/"&gt;Why You Should Stop Saying ‘Should’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It puts the focus on what you’re not doing instead of all the things you are doing. Not recognizing your successes and achievements keeps you on quest to fulfill impossible standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/blue-skunk-blog/2013/6/6/is-subversion-the-only-way.html"&gt;Doug Johnson&lt;/a&gt; writes about the decisions one must make when deciding what to do when your vision doesn't align with your organization's goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Writing vs Speaking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://johnaugust.com/2013/writing-vs-speaking"&gt;John August&lt;/a&gt; brings us a TED talk by &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/UmvOgW6iV2s"&gt;John McWhorter&lt;/a&gt; titled &lt;strong&gt;Txtng is killing language. JK!!!&lt;/strong&gt;. Mr. August discusses the various differences between writing, speaking, and elaborates on Mr. McWhorter's take on texting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;McDonald's Theory&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Don Bell uses what he calls &lt;a href="https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/9216e1c9da7d"&gt;the McDonald's Theory&lt;/a&gt; to jump start the decision process with groups.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2013 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-06-13:2013/06/13/t3-for-june-13-2013-subversion-writing-and-mcdonalds/</guid></item><item><title>T3 June 6,2013 - Quitting, the box, and a font</title><link>http://ryancollins.org/2013/06/06/t3-june-6-2013-quitting-the-box-and-a-font/</link><description>&lt;h1&gt;In Pursuit of Happiness&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is an impassioned teacher's resignation video. Her speech won't be a revelation for teachers. I'm posting it for those out there who feel the same way, &lt;strong&gt;You're not alone&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uH9vxq1iJVM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fascinating aspect of watching this on Youtube is the number of &lt;em&gt;I quit&lt;/em&gt; videos from other teachers listed in the &lt;strong&gt;What's related&lt;/strong&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Embrace the box&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ransomtech.edublogs.org/2013/05/29/embrace-the-box/"&gt;Stephen Ransom shares a TED video&lt;/a&gt; in which he reflects on how teachers use limitations as a reason not to do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This font came up on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RichLewis007/status/341935394746667010"&gt;Twitter from RichLewis007&lt;/a&gt;. It's a font like Wingdings, but with icons like you see in apps and on websites. It would make a great addition to your computer, especially if you are creating help sheets for students or teachers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2013 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-06-06:2013/06/06/t3-june-6-2013-quitting-the-box-and-a-font/</guid><category>teaching</category><category>fonts</category><category>creativity</category><category>limitations</category></item><item><title>Thursday 3 for May 16, 2013</title><link>http://ryancollins.org/2013/05/16/thursday-3-for-may-16-2013/</link><description>&lt;h1&gt;Forecast.io&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read about &lt;a href="http://forecast.io/"&gt;Forecast&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2013/04/forecast-lines.html"&gt;Macdrifter&lt;/a&gt;. This isn't your everyday weather site. A couple of things make it unique. On the main website there is a time machine button, which allows you to look at what the weather was in the past. The other neat feature is that if you visit it from an iOS device, it asks you to install it as an HTML5 app. Nice, functional and free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;IFTTT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An oldie but a goodie, &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/dashboard"&gt;If This Then That - IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; lets you automate web services. For example, I use the Pocket read it later service. I also want to keep a copy of anything sent to Pocket just in case something happens to Pocket, so I have an IFTTT recipe that saves to Dropbox anything that I Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;f.lux - Better lighting... for your computer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stereopsis.com/flux/"&gt;f.lux&lt;/a&gt; changes the &lt;em&gt;whiteness&lt;/em&gt; of your computer after sunset, giving it a yellowish hue. This is more pleasing to the eye in the dark and could help you sleep. Availble for Mac, Windows, Linux and jailbroken iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2013 17:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-05-16:2013/05/16/thursday-3-for-may-16-2013/</guid><category>software</category><category>weather</category><category>f.lux</category><category>ifttt</category></item><item><title>T3: Copyrights, bosses, and MOOCs</title><link>http://ryancollins.org/2013/02/07/t3-copyrights-bosses-and-moocs/</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/prince-georges-considers-copyright-policy-that-takes-ownership-of-students-work/2013/02/02/dc592dea-6b08-11e2-ada3-d86a4806d5ee_story.html"&gt;Prince George’s considers copyright policy that takes ownership of students’ work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main cornerstones of education is sharing. What one teacher
or student creates is freely shared with others, for the benefits of the
system. Unfortunately, Prince George is currently review a policy that
would assign all work completed by teachers and students to the
district. From what I understand about copyright, teacher work could
conceivably fall under &lt;em&gt;work for hire&lt;/em&gt;, which means the school district
could assert this ownership. But should they? For students the legality
is a bit murky. Since the students do not work for the district, it
would be a stretch to believe that the district could assert copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://stevekeating.me/2013/02/04/why-bosses-are-poor-leaders/"&gt;Why “Bosses” are Poor Leaders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bosses are a dime a dozen. Leaders can be one in a million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of another quote I've read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do things for your boss because you have to, you do things for a
leader because you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/02/04/coursera-forced-call-mooc-amid-complaints-about-course"&gt;Coursera forced to call off a MOOC amid complaints about the course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As MOOCs grow in popularity, there will be growing pains, and here is a
story with 40,000 of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the comments on blogs and Twitter: "Wowzers, 40,000 students
signed up for #foemooc considering google spreadsheets limit of 50
simultaneous editors ... not a good choice!"&lt;/p&gt;

I was
extremely lucky and grateful for a chance to attend last year, and
attend isn't quite the right word to use. A better word would be
&lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is EduCon?&lt;br /&gt;
 EduCon is both a conversation and a conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an innovation conference where we can come together, both in
person and virtually, to discuss the future of schools. Every session
will be an opportunity to discuss and debate ideas — from the very
practical to the big dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Videos of Educon sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/educon204"&gt;All of the sessions are available to watch on Youtube!&lt;/a&gt;. Try not to
be overwhelmed by the number of videos, just take one a day/week/month.
A great resource for an edchat in your school district and a glimpse
into how learning takes place in other schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Preaching to the #educhoir Really DOES Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written about the &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/2011/11/30/beware-of-the-echo-chamber/"&gt;echo chamber&lt;/a&gt; before and the perils therein,
but Bill Ferriter writes how sometimes &lt;a href="http://teacherleaders.typepad.com/the_tempered_radical/2013/01/preaching-to-the-educhoir-matters.html"&gt;you need the echo chamber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple truth is that being a change agent can be a REALLY lonely
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hashtag visualization of Educon 2.5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonbecker"&gt;Jonathan Becker&lt;/a&gt; has put together a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonbecker"&gt;visualization of all the
tweets&lt;/a&gt; with the [hashtag #educon][]. It drags my
machine down to a crawl, but it is still useful. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2013 10:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-01-31:2013/01/31/thursday-3-for-jan-31-2013-educon-2-5/</guid></item><item><title>Thursday 3s for Jan. 24, 2013: Student tech skills, tablets vs. IWBs, and menu calendar</title><link>http://ryancollins.org/2013/01/24/thursday-3s-for-jan-24-2013-student-tech-skills-tablets-vs-iwbs-and-menu-calendar/</link><description>&lt;h1&gt;5 technology skills every student needs before they leave high school&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Kaiser writes about &lt;a href="http://web20edu.com/2011/05/24/5-technology-skills-every-student-needs-before-they-leave-high-school/"&gt;5 technology skills every student needs
before they leave high school&lt;/a&gt;. Technology moves fast, but even this
article which is almost 2 years old holds relevance today. What is
missing is the mobile component, which in 2011 wouldn't be as obvious as
it is today. All of his skills can be done with the most basic of hand
held devices today, but in your classrooms, how many of these skills are
being used?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why AppleTV &amp;amp; iPad beats Interactive Whiteboard?.every time&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ryanorilio.wordpress.com/2013/01/20/why-appletv-an-ipad-beats-a-smartboard-everytime/"&gt;Why AppleTV &amp;amp; iPad beats Interactive Whiteboard?.every time&lt;/a&gt;. Pretty
much sums up my thoughts on the subject. :-) Along the same lines is an
article from Information Week on &lt;a href="http://www.informationweek.com/why-tablets-will-kill-smart-boards-in-cl/240145886"&gt;Why Tablets Will Kill Smart Boards In
Classrooms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;DAY-O&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/day-o.png" /&gt;Running OS X and want to make that menu clock more useful? Check
out &lt;a href="http://shauninman.com/archive/2011/10/20/day_o_mac_menu_bar_clock"&gt;Day-O&lt;/a&gt;. It replaces the menu bar clock that still shows the date
and time, but when you click on it, Day-O gives you a monthly calendar.
Quite handy when you want to look for a date quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2013 10:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-01-24:2013/01/24/thursday-3s-for-jan-24-2013-student-tech-skills-tablets-vs-iwbs-and-menu-calendar/</guid></item></channel></rss>
