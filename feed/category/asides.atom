&lt;li&gt;Student TED Talks. Student as the expert, demonstrate passion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube channel for TED youth videos. All presenters under 21.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Minecraft to model places from their studies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@StacyHaw: @mr_rcollins @hammanmath had her #blendedlearning Ss do TED or Ignite talks for their capstone. It was AMAZING! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symbaloo - next generation webquests. Students curate resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@StacyHaw: Just subscribed to TEDxYouth http://t.co/OjSlk4DvrO Over 4000 videos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a website for the portfolio. They're using Google Sites, I like Wordpress. :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animoto for presentations. Limited to 30 seconds for free. @sixthKMS this could be something for your commercials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screencasting. Screencast-o-matic for 15 mins. TechSmith Snagit for Chrome. (There is also Screencastify for Chromebooks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wideo.co - Video comics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucid Press - Desktop Publishing for the 21st century. Create online and offline documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socrative and Kahoot for exit slips, formative assessments, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonus resources: Common Craft Videos, BitStrips, Magisto (like Animoto) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Quotes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@daniellebezik: Teach out of your comfort zone, Ss learn more when T is also learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@StacyHaw: Having a trust relationship is at the center of authentic collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Creating 21st century assignments: autonomous, mas tery learning&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the heart of everything is empathy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spends 1st ~4 weeks on building legacy, very little content. Build relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students move at their own pace toward mastery through autonomy. "Change your philosophy first"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"We strive to inspire, not motivate. What is your legacy?"&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;"The world you grew up in does not exist and will never again exist" - @ProfessorMike1 @GarthHolman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Require a blog for students. They must publish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Blogs aren't graded. Once you start grading creative writing, students write what they think you want to read."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Totally differentiated classroom everyday for every student."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team taught 30 miles away. Posted Skype conversations. 20% students in Chardon don't have Internet access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites to check out Diigo and Quizstar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Teach kids how to differentiate for themselves. Technology makes it possible."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagrok - search tool for students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"High school students share resources with 7th graders"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"We're killing kids with worksheets. They're capable of so much more." &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tech skills 4 the next generation of assessments"&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started with a Google Doc, going through the standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ELA Common Core &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt; Pulled out anchor standards with technology. Tech may apply to only some grade levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://t.co/HIecN7CLaR"&gt;Technology Skills Checklist for Online Assessments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once they broke down the standards, looked at tools to support. Most of the statements don't reference technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geography used specific technologies the most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PARCC is only the assessment, Common Core is the standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Using iBooks Author To Write &amp;amp; Publish Student Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kids don't see the value in writing for one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No sense of contribution to society&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are not leaving behind a legacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developed the idea, all students wrote a chapter one, then collaborated on which parts will be included in the final book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let Ss write about what the Ss are struggling with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Math Our Way, math textbook written by 6th graders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other books&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was a dark and stormy classroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canterbury Remixed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May we suggest...?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked with the speed pathologist and some autistic students to write &lt;strong&gt;Social Skills Volume I&lt;/strong&gt; Became the stars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19 books published in the last two years. ~22,000 downloads. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 48+ countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's more than the downloads, motivation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get permission slips/media release form/etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wants more student and teacher created ebooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://t.co/rECj5DQsSr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kids need to be creating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sense of community&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say I’m disappointed that Google views education through such a narrow lens is an understatement. For a company that has been built on innovation to invest millions into a program that levels books, awards points for low-level knowledge and comprehension, and creates bad data is a travesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you call this personalized learning? What’s personalized about letting a computer system match kids with books?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re missing the point about what reading instruction should be, and you are helping to systematically destroy the joy in books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though many feel that there are already too many gadgets and too much internet in kids' lives, Arboleda and One Laptop per Child have the opposite viewpoint. He said that a laptop could become a precious, transformational object for a child, taking them to new places in their personal development -- especially if coupled with internet access. As for the sorry state of computer science in schools stateside, Yongpradit emphasized the need for teacher certification programs in computing, building a curriculum the same way math and sciences were: one block at a time. Arboleda took it a step further, saying that access to digital tools and internet has become "a basic human right" -- severely disadvantaging those who lack them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are committed teachers who want to take the magic out of mathematics and focus on the beauty of sense-making. We wish for teachers everywhere to seek coherence and connection rather than offer students memorized procedures and short-cutting tricks. Students are capable of rich conceptual understanding; don't rob them of the opportunity to experience the discovery of new concepts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a &lt;a href="http://www.nixthetricks.com/Download.html"&gt;free eBook&lt;/a&gt; about the math
tricks that masquerade as teaching concepts. I have mixed feelings, it seems
like I use a lot of tricks. But at the same time, I do understand the concepts
and why the trick works. Maybe that's the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond being an essential basic skill, note-taking offers students the opportunity to make the material their own. That doesn’t involve making it mean whatever they want it to mean, but it does allow them to interact with it in ways that develop the learner’s understanding of it. Now, this doesn’t happen when students equate note-taking with stenography and copy down exactly what the teacher says, and it doesn’t happen when students recopy their notes and think that’s studying. But it does happen when students work on and with their notes—when they put definitions into their own works, when they list relevant pages in the text, when they re-order the material so that it better connects with their knowledge, and when they write summaries and relate details to main points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropbox is an essential for me. I like apps that link with Dropbox in every way and it is an essential part of my paperless routine with my students. This past Sunday at #txeduchat I was asked some specific questions about how I use Dropbox to take my classroom as paperless as possible, so I thought I’d make it my app of the week and teach you some things that might be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, however, we had a rare opportunity to explore such relationships when the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art opened in Bentonville, Ark. Through a large-scale, random-assignment study of school tours to the museum, we were able to determine that strong causal relationships do in fact exist between arts education and a range of desirable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who, by lottery, were selected to visit the museum on a field trip demonstrated stronger critical thinking skills, displayed higher levels of social tolerance, exhibited greater historical empathy and developed a taste for art museums and cultural institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, we can admire the application for its survival, an anachronism of
the now defunct 90s PC era, a pre-web program written at a time when NT Server
terrorized the data center landscape with the confidence of a T-Rex born to
yuppie dinosaur parents who fully bought into the illusion of their son’s utter
uniqueness because the big-mouthed, tiny-armed monster infant could mimic the
gestures of The Itsy-Bitsy Pterodactyl. There was a similar outcry when we
moved away from Outlook’s suite-mates in the Microsoft Office dreadnaught. But
whether it’s familiarity, laziness or simple stubbornness dressed in a cloak of
Ayn Randian Objectivism, the time has come to move on, commrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a fascinating question. There’s a painting of a classroom by Laurentius de Voltolina from 1350 that shows it’s not working. Students are talking to each other or falling asleep while the teacher drones on. Why has this perpetuated? I don’t know. In our workshops we tell people to go to Second Life and check out a classroom—and they’re exactly like they are in the real world. It’s strange, because this is a place you can move by teleporting, you can do whatever you want. So using space in the same way is strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;School had never been challenging for her. She sat in rows with the other students while teachers told the kids what they needed to know. It wasn’t hard to repeat it back, and she got good grades without thinking too much. As she headed into fifth grade, she assumed she was in for more of the same—lectures, memorization, and busy work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day Juárez Correa went to his whiteboard and wrote "1 = 1.00." Normally, at this point, he would start explaining the concept of fractions and decimals. Instead he just wrote "1/2 = ?" and "1/4 = ?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Think about that for a second," he said, and walked out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No standardized tests, no written homework, no tracking. These are some of the new actions China is taking to lessen student academic burden. The Chinese Ministry of Education released Ten Regulations to Lessen Academic Burden for Primary School Students this week for public commentary. The Ten Regulations are introduced as one more significant measure to reform China’s education, in addition to further reduction of academic content, lowering the academic rigor of textbooks, expanding criteria for education quality, and improving teacher capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information was posted by Yong Zhao at &lt;a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/international_perspectives/2013/10/be_careful_what_you_wish_for.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-TW"&gt;Education Week&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has been held as an example of a high performing education system and a model worth imitating (e.g., a call for longer school days and years). But, the Chinese apparently think otherwise. They have been eager to be rid of the primary factor contributing to their outstanding test scores and the very aspect of education that Western countries are eager to borrow. The reason is very simple: The Chinese have seen enough damage done by an overemphasis on testing and academic work on creativity, innovation, and student psychological and physical well-being.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second lesson comes from the difficulty of moving away from a testing culture once it takes root. In China, test scores determine a student's life--scores in primary schools determine which middle school a student can attend; scores in middle school determine which high school a student can go to; and scores at the end of high school, the infamous College Entrance Exam or Gaokao, determine which college a student can attend, if at all, and such a decision also determines one's future career and social status. Consequently, tests dominate a child's life and by association, the reputation of a school and teachers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I do disagree with some of these commandments (such as minimizing supplemental materials, but  I don't know what is a supplemental material). The "no homework" commandment is intriguing also.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="testing"></category><category term="china"></category></entry><entry><title>Using an iPad with your reading workshop</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/11/09/using-an-ipad-with-your-reading-workshop/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-11-09T23:49:21-05:00</published><updated>2013-11-09T23:49:21-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-11-09:/2013/11/09/using-an-ipad-with-your-reading-workshop/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/top-teaching/2013/09/how-technology-can-support-and-enhance-your-reading-workshop"&gt;How Technology Can Support and Enhance Your Reading Workshop&lt;/a&gt; writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most of my planning, I started with the end in mind. I thought to myself, "What if students could jot their thinking down, in real time, and receive feedback without interrupting the workshop?" Even if they didn't receive feedback in the moment, could they at least jot their notes down to share at a more appropriate time? This is when I started using our reading notebooks in a more meaningful manner. I began to model "during reading" responses instead of only "after reading" responses. We began to use our notebooks in a more authentic way. After workshop, we would have rich, shared discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for everyone to have the opportunity to share would have taken too long. So, instead of having one child share at a time, I started utilizing partnership and small group sharing. This worked well, but not every child had the chance to grow from the group's thinking. I wished there was a way that each child had a chance to share their thinking with the whole group. This way, the odds of receiving specific feedback that would be most beneficial would be enhanced. The more minds working together, the better.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been battling the notion of "designing instruction for learning styles" in my own quixotic fashion for a couple of decades now. In my attempt to be a good steward of my clients' shareholders' equity I wished to help them avoid faddish instructional design practices that have been disproven by empirical research. I first learned back in the 1980s at NSPI (now ISPI) conferences that while self-reported learning style preferences do exist, that designing instruction to accommodate them has no basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, research dates back 30 years yet we still hear about accommodating the different learning styles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="learningstyle"></category></entry><entry><title>Technology the great leveller</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/11/02/technology-the-great-leveller/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-11-02T21:20:41-04:00</published><updated>2013-11-02T21:20:41-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-11-02:/2013/11/02/technology-the-great-leveller/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/uk/is-technology-the-great-educational-leveller-7000022554/"&gt;Is Technology the Great Educational Leveller?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of California's poorest school districts, the Coachella Valley Unified southeast of Los Angeles, is currently rolling out iPads to every student, pre-kindergarten through high school. It's an ambitious effort that administrators and parents hope will transform how kids learn, boost achievement and narrow the digital divide with wealthier districts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as with tablet efforts across the country, this one faces skeptics and obstacles. Some wonder if its projected benefits are being grossly oversold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everytime I read one of these articles, the emphasis seems to dwell on the device. It's as if there exists the perfect device and every district that picks something different is doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company admits that this isn't a "perfect scientific simulation", but there's such thing as "good enough" here. The goal is to get kids and others interested in quantum physics, and judging from a quick demo, it looks to have major potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much innovation as the iPad may bring to the classroom, it's not going to replace a teacher anytime soon. In fact, the influx of technology like iPads means there is a greater need for teachers. We need teachers who are part early adopter, part integrator, and part mad scientist. The modern teacher must be willing to take chances and able to figure out how not just how technology works, but how it works for each student, and where its use is most appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zachary Loeb (who writes as the Luddbrarian on the blog librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com) notes that "although college students have a huge amount of information available to them, this does not automatically mean that they have acquired all of the information literacy necessary to really make sense of this mass amount of information. As a result the library staff becomes an increasingly important resource for students wading through the information glut, especially as library staff are often available to students in numerous ways (in person, e-mail, chat, by phone)." This is particularly true for adult learners who return to higher education after many years away from the classroom and who often find virtual research daunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was once in New York, and I listened to a talk about the building of private prisons – a huge growth industry in America.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was once in New York, and I listened to a talk about the building of private prisons – a huge growth industry in America. The prison industry needs to plan its future growth – how many cells are they going to need? How many prisoners are there going to be, 15 years from now? And they found they could predict it very easily, using a pretty simple algorithm, based on asking what percentage of 10 and 11-year-olds couldn't read. And certainly couldn't read for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not one to one: you can't say that a literate society has no criminality. But there are very real correlations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting start, although the prison planning story appears to be an &lt;a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2010/03/prisons_dont_use_reading_score.html"&gt;urban myth&lt;/a&gt; without any &lt;a href="http://jamesshelley.net/2011/12/cite-the-source/"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But later Mr. Gaiman hits pay dirt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think there is such a thing as a bad book for children. Every now and again it becomes fashionable among some adults to point at a subset of children's books, a genre, perhaps, or an author, and to declare them bad books, books that children should be stopped from reading. I've seen it happen over and over; Enid Blyton was declared a bad author, so was RL Stine, so were dozens of others. Comics have been decried as fostering illiteracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's tosh. It's snobbery and it's foolishness. There are no bad authors for children, that children like and want to read and seek out, because every child is different. They can find the stories they need to, and they bring themselves to stories. A hackneyed, worn-out idea isn't hackneyed and worn out to them. This is the first time the child has encountered it. Do not discourage children from reading because you feel they are reading the wrong thing. Fiction you do not like is a route to other books you may prefer. And not everyone has the same taste as you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not just for the use of the word &lt;em&gt;tosh&lt;/em&gt;.  This needs to be shouted from the rooftops, posted in every school, said at every parent/teacher conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard that Ada Lovelace Day was coming, I questioned myself, “What do I actually know about Ada Lovelace?” The sum total of my knowledge: Ada was the first woman programmer and the Department of Defense honored her contributions to computation in 1979 by naming its common programming language Ada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Ada biographies later, I know Augusta Ada Lovelace to be an incredibly complex woman with a painful life story, one in which math, shame, and illness were continuously resurfacing themes. Despite all, Ada tirelessly pursued her passion for mathematics, making her contributions to computing undeniable and her genius all the more clear. Her accomplishments continue to serve as an inspiration to women throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet has replaced the importance of libraries as a repository for knowledge. And digital distribution has replaced the role of a library as a central hub for obtaining the containers of such knowledge: books. And digital bits have replaced the need to cut down trees to make paper and waste ink to create those books. This is evolution, not devolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate Microsoft Word. I want Microsoft Word to die. I hate Microsoft Word with a burning, fiery passion. I hate Microsoft Word the way Winston Smith hated Big Brother. Our reasons are, alarmingly, not dissimilar ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Word is a tyrant of the imagination, a petty, unimaginative, inconsistent dictator that is ill-suited to any creative writer's use. Worse: it is a near-monopolist, dominating the word processing field. Its pervasive near-monopoly status has brainwashed software developers to such an extent that few can imagine a word processing tool that exists as anything other than as a shallow imitation of the Redmond Behemoth. But what exactly is wrong with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've moved to formatting with Markdown in most of my writing, with a smattering of Google Docs. I don't remember the last time I used Word (although I do fire up LibreOffice from time to time). In a lot of businesses Word is integrated into a lot of workflows that would be hard to replace. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="word"></category></entry><entry><title>See what happens when a father decides to do his daughter's eight grade homework</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/10/11/see-what-happens-when-a-father-decides-to-do-his-daughters-eight-grade-homework/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-10-11T22:20:06-04:00</published><updated>2013-10-11T22:20:06-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-10-11:/2013/10/11/see-what-happens-when-a-father-decides-to-do-his-daughters-eight-grade-homework/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/10/my-daughters-homework-is-killing-me/309514/"&gt;My Daughter’s Homework Is Killing Me &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found, at both schools, that whenever I bring up the homework issue with teachers or administrators, their response is that they are required by the state to cover a certain amount of material. There are standardized tests, and everyone—students, teachers, schools—is being evaluated on those tests. I’m not interested in the debates over teaching to the test or No Child Left Behind. What I am interested in is what my daughter is doing during those nightly hours between 8 o’clock and midnight, when she finally gets to bed. During the school week, she averages three to four hours of homework a night and six and a half hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi started life as an idea to bring computing in schools back to the era of the BBC Micro in the early 1980s, which inspired children to learn how a computer worked and allowed them to discover what was possible through learning to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What was needed was a return to an exciting, programmable machine like the old BBC Micro; and it had to be affordable, say around £20, so every child could potentially have one," explained Eben Upton co-founder of the Raspberry Pi at its launch. "Computing wasn't being seen as the exciting, vibrant subject it should be at school – it had become lacklustre and even boring."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been studying how we could use the Raspberry Pi in out classrooms. The lack of monitors with DVI or HDMI connectors have been a stumbling block, along with the lack of Flash and mediocre performance as a desktop. Although, that's not the role the Raspberry Pi was designed to fill, it would be a good entry into the classroom. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="raspberrypi"></category></entry><entry><title>Finding a school Chief Technology Officer is hard</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/10/09/finding-a-school-chief-technology-officer-is-hard/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-10-09T21:09:56-04:00</published><updated>2013-10-09T21:09:56-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-10-09:/2013/10/09/finding-a-school-chief-technology-officer-is-hard/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/10/02/06el-cto-side.h33.html?intc=EW-MDD13-EWH"&gt;Education Week: Talented Chief Tech Officers Hard to Find for K-12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like technology itself, the job description of the district chief technology officer is changing rapidly—and often dramatically—as public education transforms around it, and through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why keeping up with the demands of the K-12 CTO's job can be difficult, because relatively few of these professionals are schooled in the perfect marriage of skills on the instructional and technical sides to make the best decisions for districts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Humphrey, an emeritus professor at Cambridge University’s Darwin College, said he would have expected that reading generally would make people more empathetic and understanding. “But to separate off literary fiction, and to demonstrate that it has different effects from the other forms of reading, is remarkable,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty amazing results from only 3-5 minutes of reading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although information technology products and services may be equally available, the innovative use of IT to create competitive differentiation has clearly been achieved y many organizations. What IT executives often lack is a contextual framework in which to explain the path to increasing value for their firms. The authors believe that this framework can be explained through the use of a needs hierarchy based on a comparison to the human psychological needs hierarchy described by Abraham Maslow more than sixty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults have worn their computer illiteracy as a badge of pride for many years now so it shouldn't surprise anyone that their children share their digital inadequacies. Moreover, neither group is even willing to try to solve a problem when they encounter it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As recent privacy and malware issues have demonstrated, there is a price to be paid for computer illiteracy. And nobody should ever be proud of being ignorant. If not knowing something is a nonissue, then it's a nonissue, but don't brag about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm seeing this more and more, people expect to be spoon fed and once you get to the third step, they believe it's too hard to do and shut down.  Are you seeing this in your district?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baltimore County will be closing its public schools early today due to the unseasonable heat. We're also seeing school closures widely in the midwest. And it really is hot. But all across the region things that aren't schools are staying open thanks to the miracle of climate control technology. The fact that we can't manage to get this done in our schools is laughably absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a recent summer day in Nashville, Kara Teising opened her Facebook page for a lunchtime scroll through her timeline when she discovered a photo posted by her son’s daycare: an image of her 18-month-old son surrounded by other toddlers, their chubby faces glued to a brightly colored, animated screen of an iPad. ....

&lt;p&gt;Do parents of today hold some ideology of childhood that doesn't include electronics? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shared my theory with Kirkorian –that we parents might idealize a childhood without technology as better. “I often hear ‘grown ups’ talk about the inherent value of ‘real’ objects over technology,” she said, “but frankly I don't see a difference (and there's no research to suggest there is one) between a stick and an iPad. Of course kids should have time to explore the natural environment and interact with other people. A more realistic question is whether an hour or two of touch-screens per day is going to devastate permanently cognitive/social development. It's unlikely, but we just don't know yet, and any answer will depend heavily on program content and the characteristics of individual children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
