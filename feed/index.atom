I've always had an interested in different writing setups, and would love to be a writer. For some reason, my lack of grammar and my legendary skill at procrastination has not resulted in the next great American novel. Here are some of my setups I've been trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Macintosh SE/30 running System 6 with Microsoft Word&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/2016/02/05/bringing-my-apple-macintosh-se-30-back-to-life/"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/2016/02/06/the-macintosh-se30-lives/"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/2016/02/07/scsi2sd-with-my-macintosh-se-30/"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; on my Macintosh SE/30 and about bringing it back to life. It works really well as a distraction free system, it's very fast, quiet, and reliable. Pulling documents off of the machine is as simple as copying them to a floppy drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;IBM Thinkpad T51e running Ubuntu at the console and using vim&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't that bad of a machine, the keyboard is really nice. Unfortunately, I can run multiple consoles and can still chat and surf (all at the console) but it's harder to not be distracted. It's really nice in the fact that I can use Dropbox or git on it, and reconfiguring the console font gave me a pretty nice font.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Atari 800 running The Last Word&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing on my Atari 800 is fun! The keyboard is really nice, and The Last Word is a fantastic word processor. Pulling files off is a little bit of a pain (saving to a disk image and then extracting the file from that disk image) and I haven't figured out a good way to send files to it for editing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Atari MegaSTe running Protext&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the keyboard on the Mega STe, but writing in Protext wasn't the best. I don't know if it was the weird interface or what, but it just wasn't a nice experience. I will probably go back to ST Writer the next time I write with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Raspberry Pi with a Nook Simple Touch display&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My newest experiment is using a Nook Simple Touch as the display. That was one feature of the Hemingwrite that I really liked, the use of an e-ink display. E-ink is the display used in the black and white e-readers,and has a very low power usage profile. The other advantage is the fact that it works well in bright light situations, such as outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this working as a prototype in my house. The Raspberry Pi is connected to my wifi, and running tmux at the console. With a rooted Nook Simple Touch, I connected to the local wifi and ran vx-connectbot which connected to my Pi. After connecting, I ran tmux -a, which then connected the vx-connectbot session with the console session, and I used the keyboard connected to the Pi but the display was on the Nook Simple Touch. I had to configure some vx-connectbot settings to get a good experience, but it worked really well. Next up is to figure out how to package the parts into something that would be portable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="distractionfree"></category></entry><entry><title>My conference checkist - 2016 edition</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2016/02/08/my-conference-checkist-2016-edition/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-08T09:44:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-02-08T09:44:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2016-02-08:/2016/02/08/my-conference-checkist-2016-edition/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I get ready for the Ohio Educational Technology Conference this week I though it would be a good idea to &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/2014/05/02/attending-a-conference-heres-my-conference-checklist-ipadsymposiumua/"&gt;revisit my conference checklist&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Charge devices and battery packs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My devices I'm currently taking are a 2010 MacBook Pro, iPad Mini 3, and iPhone 6 Plus. I'd like …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I get ready for the Ohio Educational Technology Conference this week I though it would be a good idea to &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/2014/05/02/attending-a-conference-heres-my-conference-checklist-ipadsymposiumua/"&gt;revisit my conference checklist&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Charge devices and battery packs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My devices I'm currently taking are a 2010 MacBook Pro, iPad Mini 3, and iPhone 6 Plus. I'd like to take my Kindle and a Raspberry Pi, but I get tired of lugging a 30 lb backpack around for three days. My current USB battery pack of choice is the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0085OB0IE?psc=1&amp;amp;redirect=true&amp;amp;ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage"&gt;PowerGen 12000mAh External Battery&lt;/a&gt; (unfortunately, it looks like it is now unavailable). The nice thing about this battery pack is that it supports pass through charging, which means I can power a Raspberry Pi and plug it in to charge without disrupting the Pi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the conference I'll rely on my iPad Mini or iPhone a majority of the time. Even though &lt;a href="http://eduk8.me/2016/01/running-a-mac-on-battery-youll-probably-want-to-switch-to-safari/"&gt;I now get almost 7 hours of battery life out of my MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, that's still not enough to get through three days of a conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Set up IFTTT to capture my notes and tweets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If This Then That (IFTTT) is a web service that can interact with services and do things on your behalf. To facilitate my note taking during conferences, I set up IFTTT to automatically append all of my tweets with the conference hashtag to a file. With this set up, I can share what I learn in the sessions and automatically save them to my notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Set up a keyboard shortcut for the conference hashtag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, to make it easier to use the conference hashtag, I will use the iPhone keyboard shortcuts and set &lt;strong&gt;ooo&lt;/strong&gt; to be the conference hashtag &lt;strong&gt;#oetc16&lt;/strong&gt;. I'll also have &lt;strong&gt;oxx&lt;/strong&gt; set for the OETCx unconference hashtag &lt;strong&gt;#oetcx&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Add a workflow to Drafts for tweeting during the conference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drafts for iOS is my go to app for creating notes and automating tasks on my iPhone. For conferences, I'll set up a workflow that will tweet the draft with the conference hashtags. With this set up, I click Drafts, type my tweet, and then run the conference tweeting workflow which will append the conference hashtag to the Tweet and then send it. Pretty nifty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Get gas, cash, and Ho Hos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ho Hos should not need an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="conference"></category><category term="checklist"></category><category term="eduk8me"></category></entry><entry><title>SCSI2SD with my Macintosh SE/30</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2016/02/07/scsi2sd-with-my-macintosh-se-30/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-07T19:19:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-02-07T19:19:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2016-02-07:/2016/02/07/scsi2sd-with-my-macintosh-se-30/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I was working on my SE/30, I knew I didn't want to go with a SCSI hard drive.

Now that it is up and running, I'm very happy with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using with an older Macintosh, you may have an issue when it comes to initializing and using a non-Apple drive. The first time, Apple HD SC Setup wouldn't find the drive. I then found this &lt;a href="https://68kmla.org/forums/index.php?/topic/24810-questions-about-scsi2sd-setup-in-mac-lc-iii/"&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt;. I followed dougg3's directions when setting up the SCSI2SD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the vendor to the string " SEAGATE" (yes, there is a single space in front of SEAGATE for a total of 8 characters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the product ID to the string "          ST225N" (10 spaces in front for a total of 16 characters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the revision to the string "1.0 " (with a space after, for a total of 4 characters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple HD SC Setup then saw the drive. The other thing I had to do was re-partition the drive after it set it up, since Apple HD SC Setup only create a 16MB partition and left the rest of the drive unpartitioned. I deleted that partition and then created a 256MB partition.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="scsi"></category><category term="scis2sd"></category></entry><entry><title>The Macintosh SE/30 lives</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2016/02/06/the-macintosh-se30-lives/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-06T09:45:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-02-06T09:45:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2016-02-06:/2016/02/06/the-macintosh-se30-lives/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight, after just a little bit of tinkering, was a good night for my Macintosh SE/30.

After I swapped the 2GB SD card in the SCSI2SD drive with a 256MB SD card, I was able to initialize the drive correctly. At first it only set up a 16MB partition, so I did have to re-partition the drive, but after that, the installation of System 6.0.7 was a breeze. And even though this thing only has 2MB of RAM, it is quick! I don't know if it's the SCSI2SD device or the fact that System 6 doesn't require a whole lot, but Microsoft Word 4.0 loads almost instantly. I'll have to measure the boot time when I get a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this blog post in Microsoft Word on the SE/30. The worst part is the fact that the keyboard needs a good cleaning. I'm not too impressed with the Apple Extended Keyboard II, although I've heard people rave about it. I think I have an IIgs compact keyboard around here somewhere to replace it. The smaller size fits better with the SE/30 anyway. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="macintosh"></category><category term="se30"></category></entry><entry><title>Bringing my Apple Macintosh SE/30 back to life</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2016/02/05/bringing-my-apple-macintosh-se-30-back-to-life/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-05T09:15:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-02-05T09:15:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2016-02-05:/2016/02/05/bringing-my-apple-macintosh-se-30-back-to-life/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Several months ago an Apple Macintosh SE/30 came across eBay at a price I was willing to pay.

I cracked open the case and put the SCSI2SD device in place, but after Apple HD Setup chewed on the drive for 20 minutes, it said initialization failed. Ugh.

That seems awfully long, lets make it shorter. You can't pass arguments to bash aliases, but you can to functions. In .bash_profile (or .bashrc, which ever runs for you by default) I added the following function:&lt;/p&gt;

    grep -ri &amp;quot;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot; ~/.bash_history_log/*

&lt;p&gt;The Atari MegaSTe was released near the end of the Atari computer era with a 68000 cpu running at 16MHz in a case that separates the keyboard with the computer itself. I'm using the Atari SC1224 color monitor with it (12" at 640x200 resolution) which is fine for most things. The mono monitor is a superb 640x400 resolution at 70Hz, but mine needs some adjusting since the screen is too small. The keyboard is pretty amazing, one of the best feeling keyboards I have every used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ST Writer is the word processor that is the heir apparent to the AtariWriter word processor for Atari's 8-bit line of computers. I used AtariWriter for at least 6 years as my word processor, and it made the most out of the 40 character wide screen. ST Writer feels like coming home, although now with 2.5MB of free space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To post the article, I will use ZModem to transfer it to my Linux box where I can fix the line endings and can then use Pelican to post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty weird to be back on a single processing system with limited Internet access. I should do this more often! &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="atarist"></category><category term="atari"></category><category term="stwriter"></category></entry><entry><title>autossh problems</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2016/01/30/autossh-problems/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-01-30T21:31:49-05:00</published><updated>2016-01-30T21:31:49-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2016-01-30:/2016/01/30/autossh-problems/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My Pi is doing a pretty good job on connecting to wifi when I travel between places.

&lt;p&gt;Click on &lt;em&gt;LAN&lt;/em&gt; on the left side, and then select the &lt;em&gt;DHCP&lt;/em&gt; tab:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Manual IP Management" src="http://cdn.ryancollins.org/pics/2016/EnableStaticIP.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the MAC address of the network port on the Pi and select an IP address that isn't being used. You'll probably want to enter the MAC address of the wifi dongle too, if you use that. The ASUS is nice because the drop down will contain the MAC addresses of the devices that have connected to it, so you should be able to go through that list until you find the correct entries. To get the MAC addresses if this method doesn't work, ssh to the pi and run &lt;code&gt;ifconfig | grep HWaddr&lt;/code&gt;. It will then show the network interfaces and their MAC addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have it set up, it's really nice playing around with your Pis. It doesn't matter what SD card you put in, as long as the Pi is set for DHCP, it will always be assigned the IP address you set.&lt;/p&gt;

I have about 20, with several different registrars. If I was smart, I would consolidate them under one registrar, but, even then, checking expirations on the domains is a pain. I usually have autorenew turned on, but I still like to know when they are getting close to expiration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before re-inventing the wheel, I did a Google search, and found &lt;a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/domain-check-script.html"&gt;Domain Expiration Check Shell Script&lt;/a&gt;. It worked pretty well, except for a few top level domains like .me which didn't work. I modified the script, and just had to put some finishing touches on it today (.com, .net,  and .org was broken).

Since I haven't come up with a purpose, I decided to make it a portable headless Linux box that will travel with me, connect to Wifi automatically, and eventually, hopefully, set it up as a &lt;a href="https://piratebox.cc/"&gt;Piratebox&lt;/a&gt;. First things first, lets get it connecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was easier than I thought it was going to be to set it to automatically connect. Basically, I modified /etc/network/interfaces to add a roam configuration for wpa supplicant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;# Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:
source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

iface eth0 inet manual

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
    # wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
    wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_roam.conf

allow-hotplug wlan1
iface wlan1 inet manual
    #wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
    wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_roam.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I just added the two lines that start with wpa-roam and commented out the default wpa_supplicant.conf lines. Next up was to create the &lt;code&gt;/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_roam.conf&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
        ssid=&amp;quot;home&amp;quot;
        key_mgmt=NONE
}
network={
        ssid=&amp;quot;iPhoneHotSpot&amp;quot;
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
        psk=&amp;quot;PASSWORD&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Adjust the parameters for your networks. Plugging the Pi into the network and manually running &lt;code&gt;sudo ifdown wlan0;sudo ifup wlan0&lt;/code&gt; is how I tested it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the pi needs to see if it doesn't have a network connection, and if it doesn't, bring wlan0 and then back up and see if it will connect. My wifi dongle (the &lt;a href="http://amzn.com/B003MTTJOY"&gt;Edimax EW-7811Un&lt;/a&gt;) is on wlan0, so you may need to modify. I set a crontab (&lt;code&gt;sudo crontab -e&lt;/code&gt;) with the following line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;* * * * * /bin/ping -q -c2 8.8.8.8 || (/sbin/ifdown --force wlan0 ;/sbin/ifup wlan0 )
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Every minute the Pi will send out two pings to Google's DNS servers, and if it doesn't get a reply, it will take the connection down and bring it back up. Now I have a Pi that will autoconnect to wifi. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="pi"></category><category term="raspberrypi"></category><category term="wifi"></category></entry><entry><title>Fixing my .taskpaper reset alias for bash</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2016/01/26/fixing-my-taskpaper-reset-alias-for-bash/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-01-26T09:01:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-01-26T09:01:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2016-01-26:/2016/01/26/fixing-my-taskpaper-reset-alias-for-bash/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was a little problem with my alias to reset a .taskpaper list by removing all of the @dones.

My problem was trying to use multiple line MySQL statements, which was messing everything up. The solution was to use bash's &lt;strong&gt;Here Documents&lt;/strong&gt;. It's a way to direct lines into a command. For me, the command looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mysql DBNAME &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE item = &amp;#39;WhatIWant&amp;#39;
EOF
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Everything between the two EOF would be submitted to MySQL. The next problem was that bash was trying to still interpret the MySQL statement which had backticks in it. To solve this issue, I learned that I needed to enclose the first EOF in quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mysql DBNAME &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;quot;EOF&amp;quot;

The problem with bash's history are twofold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It only saves history when the terminal exits cleanly, so if your connection drops or you have to kill the current process, you lose your history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are running multiple terminals, or using a terminal multiplexer like tmux (my favorite!) or screen, the last bash to exit overwrites any other history with its history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after &lt;a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1288/preserve-bash-history-in-multiple-terminal-windows"&gt;a little searching&lt;/a&gt; I've found a solution that works for me for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt; in .bash_history_log. That folder will need to be created.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;HISTFILE=&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;/.bash_history_log/bash_history_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;HISTSUFFIX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

I could work on the content, and not get distracted by the interface. Luckily, I didn't have to look any further than &lt;a href="http://pandoc.org/"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt;. Pandoc can take a multitude of formats and convert to other formats. For example, to create a presentation from a Markdown file, a simple &lt;code&gt;pandoc -t revealjs -s presentation.markdown -o presentation.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the presentation is viewable, you need to download the &lt;a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases"&gt;reveal.js framework&lt;/a&gt;. Unzip it and rename the folder to &lt;strong&gt;reveal.js&lt;/strong&gt; and put it in the same place as the html file created by &lt;a href="http://pandoc.org/"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt;. You can then open the html file up in your browser and present away! The easiest way to publish the presentation publicly would probably be in Dropbox. Share the link to the html publicly and you should be good to go (your mileage may vary, I haven't tested this yet).&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, since IPv6 is widely deployed, I am stuck sshing into one host that is publically accessible, and from there sshing into other hosts. Cumbersome to say the least, but it does look cool when I'm showing it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you can automate the connection with netcat on the gateway host. I like to put my ssh commands into my ~/.ssh/config file so then I don't have to remember anything. To jump to an internal host from the gateway I add the following to my ~/.ssh/config file on the client (most notably, &lt;a href="http://eduk8.me/2016/01/teaching-an-old-macbook-pro-new-tricks/"&gt;my 2010 MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Host macmini
    hostname LOCALIP
    user gadmin
    ProxyCommand ssh USER@GATEWAY nc %h %p
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Replace LOCALIP with the address of the host to which you want to jump, and replace USER@GATEWAY with the gateway's username and address. You can use other hosts defined in your ~/.ssh/config file, so if you have a host for GATEWAY, you can use it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ssh"></category><category term="proxy"></category></entry><entry><title>Resetting a .taskpaper file</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2016/01/18/resetting-a-taskpaper-file/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-01-18T20:44:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-01-18T20:44:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2016-01-18:/2016/01/18/resetting-a-taskpaper-file/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I use a couple of .taskpaper files for checklists of things that need to be done every day.

So it shouldn't be surprised that I also use RSS even as others have abandoned it for things like Twitter. I prefer to supplement my news feeds with Twitter and not replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the demise of Google Reader, I've settled on Feedly as my RSS reader. It's web interface has keyboard shortcuts, and the Reeder app works very well on my iPhone and iPad. But I think it could be faster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Back to 1990&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before web forums were all the rage, there was Usenet News. It was international, and distributed, which made it very resilient. It was also, for the most part, limited to text interfaces. There were several GUI interfaces for accessing Usenet, but for me, the command line application tin was all I needed. With it I could navigate an alarming amount of posts, selecting the ones I wanted to read while ignore the rest. It was pretty amazing how fast the whole process was. Alas, speed is something we lost on the transition to graphically interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Enter Newsbeuter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://newsbeuter.org/"&gt;Newsbeuter&lt;/a&gt; is an open source command line RSS reader that can run on most UNIX based operating systems. A simple &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install newsbeuter&lt;/code&gt; installed it on my Ubuntu host, and I was good to go. I'm still in the honeymoon phase, so we'll see how long it lasts. To see it in action you can &lt;a href="http://newsbeuter.org/screenshots.html"&gt;check out the screenshots&lt;/a&gt; on the Newsbeuter site.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="rss"></category><category term="newsbeuter"></category></entry><entry><title>Publishing using Sphinx to Github</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2015/06/23/publishing-using-sphinx-to-github/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-23T11:43:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-23T11:43:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2015-06-23:/2015/06/23/publishing-using-sphinx-to-github/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been playing around with &lt;a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; as a digital publishing tool.

An example is the &lt;a href="http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"&gt;Sublime Text Unofficial Documentation&lt;/a&gt;. If you click on the &lt;strong&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/strong&gt; link in the bottom left of the window, you can see the documentation in other formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://readthedocs.org/"&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt; will automatically create a website and other files from a Github repository, but you can also publish yourself to Github without using another service. My problem came from an issue with Github ignoring the folder &lt;em&gt;_static&lt;/em&gt;, which is where Sphinx puts assets for the website. The solution is simple enough, have a &lt;em&gt;.nojekyll&lt;/em&gt; file in the root of the website. The question was how to do that automatically. What I did was add a new target to the Makefile[1]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;github&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SPHINXBUILD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ALLSPHINXOPTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BUILDDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;touch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BUILDDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nojekyll&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ghp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BUILDDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;gh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pages&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@echo&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Published to Github&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now when I type &lt;code&gt;make github&lt;/code&gt;, the website will be rebuilt, a &lt;em&gt;.nojekyll&lt;/em&gt; file will be created, the website will be imported into the gh-pages branch and that branch will be pushed to Github.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's what I've found out, most people dislike being told "this is easy" when they are learning new technology. The irony is not lost on me, since if it was so easy, why am I teaching it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads into something that I've begun to realize. There is no easy. Life is hard, difficult, and the lessons can be harsh. Technology is no different. Take the iPhone for example. Seven years ago it was hailed as an easy to use smartphone. Part of that ease of use came from the fact that it didn't do much. You didn't have to know how to copy and paste, since it couldn't do that. There was no app store, so you didn't have to learn how to install and remove apps. No notifications to learn how to control. No multitasking of apps to learn how to switch between. No privacy controls. Etc. All of these have now been added to iOS, making it more complicated but more useful device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this makes it even more difficult to learn how to use technology effectively. There will always be something new to learn tomorrow. When I'm working with teachers I'm often asked why I don't have all of this "how to use" tips written down. The problem is that I could talk for a day on just all the features that Google GMail has, and still not hit everything you can do with it. &lt;em&gt;Teach Like a Hacker&lt;/em&gt; started as a way to demonstrate alternative uses of the technology teachers already know, and use that as a stepping stone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="easy"></category></entry><entry><title>Attending a conference?

As I've attended numerous conferences throughout my professional career, I've started to realize I should create a to do list so I don't forget anything before a conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;1. Charge my devices and battery packs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My usual compliment of devices I take to a conference consists of my laptop, iPad, and iPhone. Along with charging them, I also have a battery case for my iPhone and a Jackery Giant USB battery pack that needs to be charged. Multi-day conferences are not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2. Set up IFTTT to capture my notes and tweets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started to use Twitter to write my notes during a conference and  &lt;a href="http://ifttt.com"&gt;If This Then That&lt;/a&gt; to capture them. The recipe I use looks for any of my tweets with the conference hashtag, and if found, it appends that tweet to a text file in &lt;a href="http://dropbox.com"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the conference I'll have an entire text file with everything I want to save from the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IFTTT Hashtag Recipe" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/Screen%20Shot%202014-05-02%20at%207.56.07%20AM.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3. Set up a keyboard shortcut for the conference hashtag&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hashtag for the conference Saturday is #iPadSymposiumUA. What I did on my iPhone and iPad is create a keyboard shortcut (Settings -&amp;gt; General -&amp;gt; Keyboard -&amp;gt; Shortcuts). The shortcut is &lt;strong&gt;iii&lt;/strong&gt; which expands to #iPadSymposiumUA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;4. Charge my name tag&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name tag I've started to use is a 4 generation iPod Touch running Keynote. I have a lanyard that connects to the dock connector, and I created a 3 slide presentation that continually loops. Keynote keeps the display on while showing a presentation. If I shut it off during sessions, the battery lasts an entire day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;5. Gas up the car, get some cash and Ho Hos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, how frustrating it can be to get in your car for a multi-hour trip and realize you have to stop for gas. Even though I hardly use cash anymore, it's a good idea to have a few bucks on you, just in case. The Ho Hos? They're self explanatory. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="conference"></category><category term="checklist"></category><category term="eduk8me"></category></entry><entry><title>Teach like a hacker - Atari version from #neotech2014</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2014/04/22/teach-like-a-hacker-atari-version-from-neotech2014/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-04-22T09:46:00-04:00</published><updated>2014-04-22T09:46:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2014-04-22:/2014/04/22/teach-like-a-hacker-atari-version-from-neotech2014/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I forgot to upload my presentation from the Neotech 2014 conference!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;At the heart of everything is empathy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spends 1st ~4 weeks on building legacy, very little content. Build relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students move at their own pace toward mastery through autonomy. "Change your philosophy first"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"We strive to inspire, not motivate. What is your legacy?"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.teachersfortomorrow.net/1/post/2014/03/neotech-2014.html"&gt;Presentation link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"The world you grew up in does not exist and will never again exist" - @ProfessorMike1 @GarthHolman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Require a blog for students. They must publish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Blogs aren't graded. Once you start grading creative writing, students write what they think you want to read."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Totally differentiated classroom everyday for every student."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team taught 30 miles away. Posted Skype conversations. 20% students in Chardon don't have Internet access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites to check out Diigo and Quizstar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Teach kids how to differentiate for themselves. Technology makes it possible."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagrok - search tool for students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"High school students share resources with 7th graders"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"We're killing kids with worksheets. They're capable of so much more." &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tech skills 4 the next generation of assessments"&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started with a Google Doc, going through the standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ELA Common Core &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt; Pulled out anchor standards with technology. Tech may apply to only some grade levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://t.co/HIecN7CLaR"&gt;Technology Skills Checklist for Online Assessments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once they broke down the standards, looked at tools to support. Most of the statements don't reference technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geography used specific technologies the most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PARCC is only the assessment, Common Core is the standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Using iBooks Author To Write &amp;amp; Publish Student Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kids don't see the value in writing for one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No sense of contribution to society&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are not leaving behind a legacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developed the idea, all students wrote a chapter one, then collaborated on which parts will be included in the final book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let Ss write about what the Ss are struggling with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Math Our Way, math textbook written by 6th graders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other books&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was a dark and stormy classroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canterbury Remixed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May we suggest...?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked with the speed pathologist and some autistic students to write &lt;strong&gt;Social Skills Volume I&lt;/strong&gt; Became the stars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19 books published in the last two years. ~22,000 downloads. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 48+ countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's more than the downloads, motivation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get permission slips/media release form/etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wants more student and teacher created ebooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://t.co/rECj5DQsSr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kids need to be creating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sense of community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rushton Hurley&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say I’m disappointed that Google views education through such a narrow lens is an understatement. For a company that has been built on innovation to invest millions into a program that levels books, awards points for low-level knowledge and comprehension, and creates bad data is a travesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you call this personalized learning? What’s personalized about letting a computer system match kids with books?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re missing the point about what reading instruction should be, and you are helping to systematically destroy the joy in books.&lt;/p&gt;

attending Beaver Local's professional development waiver day. It was a
twofer for me, I not only got a chance to see how they ran their waiver
day PD, but I also had the
chance to present and converse with the staff in the district. This was
invaluable to me, and I was very appreciative to have the chance to
attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Ohio eTech Conference I've been trying to screencast everytime
I teach or present. Here are the 5 presentions from Wednesday:&lt;/p&gt;

It is also prettier. :-) (I also stumbled acrossed &lt;a href="http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-irc/wiki/"&gt;Tiny Tiny IRC&lt;/a&gt; tonight, but the install is a little more involved, so this will be a later project.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this tutorial, you'll be using Google Chrome. There is a Chatzilla add on for Firefox, and if there is a demand, I'll put together a tutorial for Firefox users (although you'll probably be able to use this one to get started with Chatzilla). In Chrome, go to the Chrome Apps store and search for &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/circ/bebigdkelppomhhjaaianniiifjbgocn?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon"&gt;CIRC&lt;/a&gt; (or click the link). Install the app, and then launch it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CIRC" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/Screen%20Shot%202014-02-13%20at%204.31.16%20PM-m.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be created with a nice chat box, but you're not connected to any servers yet. Before you connect to a server, you'll need to set a nickname. In the message box, type &lt;code&gt;/nick NICKNAME&lt;/code&gt; where NICKNAME is the nickname you want to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Set Nickname" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/Screen%20Shot%202014-02-13%20at%204.38.16%20PM-l.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you are ready to connect. In the message box, type &lt;code&gt;/server talk.eduk8.me&lt;/code&gt; (If you haven't noticed, all of the IRC commands start with a slash (/)). CIRC will connect you to the server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Join Server" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/Screen%20Shot%202014-02-13%20at%204.38.30%20PM-l.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once on the server, you need to connect to a room. Type &lt;code&gt;/join #tlah&lt;/code&gt; to join the &lt;strong&gt;Teach Like a Hacker&lt;/strong&gt;. Rooms are created and destroyed on the fly. If you join a room that doesn't exists, a room will be created. And as soon as the last person leaves a room, the room is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Join #tlah" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/Screen%20Shot%202014-02-13%20at%204.38.44%20PM-l.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you're in the room, start typing! On the left you will see a list of members of the current room along with a list of connected servers and channels. Anything typed in the box that doesn't begin with a slash will be sent to everyone in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pictures were taken with a Sony Mavica floppy disk camera at a
whopping 640x480 resolution, with us pretty much making up the story as we went
along. I can't remember what software we used though. The credits said
&lt;em&gt;Made with Macintosh&lt;/em&gt;, so in 1999 that would be the Avid movie software
that Apple was bundling with Macs at the time (iMovie wasn't until
October of that year). I had just learned that there are pickles called
&lt;em&gt;sweet gherkins&lt;/em&gt;, which I thought was hilarious, so that had to be the
name of the villain. Our protagonist was a parody of Indiana Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resultant movie still makes me chuckle. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopmotion is such a neat storytelling format, and it's relatively easy
to do. Especially with all the software and digital cameras that are
available now. In '99 we had to juggle floppy disks. Sometimes the disk
would go bad and we would have to redo the shots. There was no frame of
reference on what the previous shot was (no onion skinning) so you just
kind of guessed. An old iPhone or iPod touch is enough to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someday we'll complete the story.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="lego"></category><category term="stopmotion"></category></entry><entry><title>How does water instantly freeze in a water bottle?</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2014/02/08/how-does-water-instantly-freeze-in-a-water-bottle/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-02-08T12:47:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-02-08T12:47:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2014-02-08:/2014/02/08/how-does-water-instantly-freeze-in-a-water-bottle/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In our garage we have some bottled water.

&lt;li&gt;Homework is not a grade; it's a behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students lost lunch with their friends if they hadn't watched videos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be consistant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short 3-6 question formative assessment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put into one of three groups based on assessment: relearn, practice, enrich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I want to know what they know right now"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asked principal to co-teach by having all the students with IEPs in the grade level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or use centers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or team with another classroom&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Differentiated assessments&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;same standards, different levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every page is a different standard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;five levels of questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low: 1-3, middle: 2-4, high: 3-5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"The definition of teaching is to ensure learning." Jim Connell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't let students off the hook, 81% on a test means they don't know 19%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;students like to hear their own teacher's voice. Can be tailored to their needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very good for students on IEPs, able to watch at their pace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good for parents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What would I do different?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;embed video in Google form for easy formative assessment&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Complete Chrome lesson, get a free tshirt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flipped classroom and ipad certification available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pitfalls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stick with it. There is a learning curve for everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a system that works for you and your students when they don't do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Teachers have started at the high school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;satisfaction, doing the right thing every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more time in class to teach and troubleshoot&lt;/li&gt;

You too can hack, come! For those that can't attend, I'll be posting my slides tomorrow and the &lt;a href="http://talk.eduk8.me/"&gt;chat room will be open&lt;/a&gt; the entire conference (chat room is also accessible over IRC, server is talk.eduk8.me, channel is #tlah). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday is a big day with the ALTconference, OETCx. Come and watch the keynote with your fellow OETC participants. It's a different experience being able to hold conversations while watching the keynote. I'll be presenting an Ignite style FRED talk that afternoon which will be exciting since it involves Star Wars. &lt;/p&gt;

in handy for others in the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I restarted my virtual private server this morning, and after it came back up I
noticed none of the websites would load. The server runs
&lt;a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/"&gt;Varnish&lt;/a&gt; as a front end to all the websites,
and all it was doing was throwing up 503 errors and guru meditations. This means
that varnish can't connect to any web server. The websites on the host are
served by nginx and apache. I double checked that they were running and that
they were on their correct ports with &lt;code&gt;netstat -tulpn&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8008            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      391/apache2
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:88              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      12365/nginx.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ok, everything is running, why won't it work!! Next is to try to telnet to the
servers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;telnet localhost 8008
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's odd, it never connects. Let me try it from my computer (IP address
obscured. Why? I don't know, it seems like a good idea :-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;telnet 75.255.255.255 8008
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It connects right away. So for some reason, the server can't connect to other
services on itself, even localhost. After some searching I came across a post
that mentions that sometimes the loopback interface doesn't come up. I check:&lt;/p&gt;

This is also the time when many start planning on new beginnings in the new year. I say, why do we wait? Shouldn't we be planning on new beginnings throughout the year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many times when starting new initiatives at school we have this urge to wait until natural breaks, such as the start of a new school year. It feels totally natural in a school setting since we have such distinct starts and stops, unlike a lot of occupations. After college I worked a couple of years at a computer store and bank. It was weird not have such breaks. To start something new, you set the date as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this doesn't happen nearly enough in a school setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible. --Harry (When Harry Met Sally)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I want to incorporate something new, I want it to start as soon as possible. Don't make me wait for some arbitrary date just because we've always done it that way. I want the rest of my life start as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year everybody!!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="newyear"></category></entry><entry><title>What a disappointing article, tablets vs. laptops</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/12/23/what-a-disappointing-article-tablets-vs-laptops/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-23T14:24:00-05:00</published><updated>2013-12-23T14:24:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-12-23:/2013/12/23/what-a-disappointing-article-tablets-vs-laptops/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scholastic has posted a versus article, &lt;a href="http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3757847"&gt;Laptop Vs

Tablet&lt;/a&gt;, where Gary
Stager and Dan Brenner duel over what is the best. Both arguments are very weak.
Mr. Stager takes the old arugment that the &lt;a href="http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3757848"&gt;iPad is a consumption
device&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPad is a consumption device. Sure, you can use it for Web browsing, video-watching, or note-taking, but the laptop affords a much greater range of expressive possibilities. Apple’s embrace of digital textbooks reinforces a quaint view of education that transfers agency from learners to publishers. The tools for creating e-books, such as iBooks Author, require Macs, but the laptop cannot read the books it creates, forcing schools to choose between textbooks and computing. Apple has made it clear that education is about content delivery and testing, no longer about the power to be your best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument is no long valid. Creation apps that I have used on my iPad include
Codea, Pythonista, iMovie, Garageband, Elements, iA Writer, Google Drive, and
QuickOffice. Instead of telling us why an iPad isn't the right tool, tell us why
a laptop is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Mr. Brenner &lt;a href="http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3757849"&gt;tells us what they do on the
iPad&lt;/a&gt;. Paperless
workflows, email, textbooks, these are some of the things they do on the
tablets. I didn't see anything in the list that you can't also do on laptops. In
fact, he ends the column with "P.S. I wrote this article on my laptop computer
at work. It seemed like the right tool for the job!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final decision in these discussions usually boil down to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we afford?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we support?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What supports our teaching?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though many feel that there are already too many gadgets and too much internet in kids' lives, Arboleda and One Laptop per Child have the opposite viewpoint. He said that a laptop could become a precious, transformational object for a child, taking them to new places in their personal development -- especially if coupled with internet access. As for the sorry state of computer science in schools stateside, Yongpradit emphasized the need for teacher certification programs in computing, building a curriculum the same way math and sciences were: one block at a time. Arboleda took it a step further, saying that access to digital tools and internet has become "a basic human right" -- severely disadvantaging those who lack them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are committed teachers who want to take the magic out of mathematics and focus on the beauty of sense-making. We wish for teachers everywhere to seek coherence and connection rather than offer students memorized procedures and short-cutting tricks. Students are capable of rich conceptual understanding; don't rob them of the opportunity to experience the discovery of new concepts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a &lt;a href="http://www.nixthetricks.com/Download.html"&gt;free eBook&lt;/a&gt; about the math
tricks that masquerade as teaching concepts. I have mixed feelings, it seems
like I use a lot of tricks. But at the same time, I do understand the concepts
and why the trick works. Maybe that's the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond being an essential basic skill, note-taking offers students the opportunity to make the material their own. That doesn’t involve making it mean whatever they want it to mean, but it does allow them to interact with it in ways that develop the learner’s understanding of it. Now, this doesn’t happen when students equate note-taking with stenography and copy down exactly what the teacher says, and it doesn’t happen when students recopy their notes and think that’s studying. But it does happen when students work on and with their notes—when they put definitions into their own works, when they list relevant pages in the text, when they re-order the material so that it better connects with their knowledge, and when they write summaries and relate details to main points.&lt;/p&gt;

This past Sunday at #txeduchat I was asked some specific questions about how I use Dropbox to take my classroom as paperless as possible, so I thought I’d make it my app of the week and teach you some things that might be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, however, we had a rare opportunity to explore such relationships when the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art opened in Bentonville, Ark. Through a large-scale, random-assignment study of school tours to the museum, we were able to determine that strong causal relationships do in fact exist between arts education and a range of desirable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who, by lottery, were selected to visit the museum on a field trip demonstrated stronger critical thinking skills, displayed higher levels of social tolerance, exhibited greater historical empathy and developed a taste for art museums and cultural institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, we can admire the application for its survival, an anachronism of
the now defunct 90s PC era, a pre-web program written at a time when NT Server
terrorized the data center landscape with the confidence of a T-Rex born to
yuppie dinosaur parents who fully bought into the illusion of their son’s utter
uniqueness because the big-mouthed, tiny-armed monster infant could mimic the
gestures of The Itsy-Bitsy Pterodactyl. There was a similar outcry when we
moved away from Outlook’s suite-mates in the Microsoft Office dreadnaught. But
whether it’s familiarity, laziness or simple stubbornness dressed in a cloak of
Ayn Randian Objectivism, the time has come to move on, commrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And please, teachers, take special heed on the PowerPoints. This was the #1 disliked practice in our student survey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too much text on each slide; and reading directly from the slide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a fascinating question. There’s a painting of a classroom by Laurentius de Voltolina from 1350 that shows it’s not working. Students are talking to each other or falling asleep while the teacher drones on. Why has this perpetuated? I don’t know. In our workshops we tell people to go to Second Life and check out a classroom—and they’re exactly like they are in the real world. It’s strange, because this is a place you can move by teleporting, you can do whatever you want. So using space in the same way is strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;School had never been challenging for her. She sat in rows with the other students while teachers told the kids what they needed to know. It wasn’t hard to repeat it back, and she got good grades without thinking too much. As she headed into fifth grade, she assumed she was in for more of the same—lectures, memorization, and busy work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day Juárez Correa went to his whiteboard and wrote "1 = 1.00." Normally, at this point, he would start explaining the concept of fractions and decimals. Instead he just wrote "1/2 = ?" and "1/4 = ?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Think about that for a second," he said, and walked out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No standardized tests, no written homework, no tracking. These are some of the new actions China is taking to lessen student academic burden. The Chinese Ministry of Education released Ten Regulations to Lessen Academic Burden for Primary School Students this week for public commentary. The Ten Regulations are introduced as one more significant measure to reform China’s education, in addition to further reduction of academic content, lowering the academic rigor of textbooks, expanding criteria for education quality, and improving teacher capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information was posted by Yong Zhao at &lt;a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/international_perspectives/2013/10/be_careful_what_you_wish_for.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-TW"&gt;Education Week&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has been held as an example of a high performing education system and a model worth imitating (e.g., a call for longer school days and years). But, the Chinese apparently think otherwise. They have been eager to be rid of the primary factor contributing to their outstanding test scores and the very aspect of education that Western countries are eager to borrow. The reason is very simple: The Chinese have seen enough damage done by an overemphasis on testing and academic work on creativity, innovation, and student psychological and physical well-being.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second lesson comes from the difficulty of moving away from a testing culture once it takes root. In China, test scores determine a student's life--scores in primary schools determine which middle school a student can attend; scores in middle school determine which high school a student can go to; and scores at the end of high school, the infamous College Entrance Exam or Gaokao, determine which college a student can attend, if at all, and such a decision also determines one's future career and social status. Consequently, tests dominate a child's life and by association, the reputation of a school and teachers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I do disagree with some of these commandments (such as minimizing supplemental materials, but  I don't know what is a supplemental material). The "no homework" commandment is intriguing also.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="testing"></category><category term="china"></category></entry><entry><title>The tide is turning against the use value-added scores with individual teachers</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/11/11/the-tide-is-turning-against-the-use-value-added-scores-with-individual-teachers/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-11-11T10:41:00-05:00</published><updated>2013-11-11T10:41:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-11-11:/2013/11/11/the-tide-is-turning-against-the-use-value-added-scores-with-individual-teachers/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Value added methods is a research methodology designed to be used at a building or district level to guage the effectiveness of instructional strategies, materials, and other aspects of how a school teaches.

&lt;p&gt;1: Value-added models of teacher effectiveness are highly unstable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that teachers’ effectiveness ratings differ substantially from class to classand from year to year,  as well as from one statistical model to the next...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2: Teachers’ value-added ratings are significantly affected by differences in the students who are assigned to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VA models require that students be assigned to teachers randomly.  However, students are not randomly assigned to teachers – and statistical models cannot fully adjust for the fact that some teachers will have a disproportionate number of students who have greater challenges (students with poor attendance, who are homeless, who have severe problems at home, etc.) and those whose scores on traditional tests may not accurately reflect their learning (e.g. those who have special education needs or who are new English language learners).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3: Value-added ratings cannot disentangle the many influences on student progress &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to fully separate out the influences of students’ other teachers, as well as school conditions, on their reported learning. No single teacher accounts for all of a student’s learning. Prior teachers have lasting effects, for good or ill, on students’ later learning, and current teachers also interact to produce students’ knowledge and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like policymakers and others are started to see the problem with using value added measures. The Ohio Senate &lt;a href="http://www.plunderbund.com/2013/11/09/ohio-senate-introduces-bill-to-change-teacher-evaluations-again/"&gt;introduced a bill this week that lowers the value added measures for teachers in grades 4-8 from 50% to 35%&lt;/a&gt;. On Techcrunch.com (a site dedicated to following the tech side of the news and start up culture) has posted an article &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/10/the-la-times-trolls-innocent-teachers/"&gt;about the LA Times shaming teachers&lt;/a&gt;. The Techcrunch author discusses a couple of problems with the use of this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is good, data is important, but data only based on standardized testing should not be the only data that is informing your decisions.

My first USB charger was a Duracell model I picked up at Meijer on the discountinued rack several years ago. It worked ok, but since them I've upgraded. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is the &lt;a href="http://amzn.com/B006FXUS1C"&gt;Tekkeon MP1580 TEKCHARGE Mobile Power Pack and Battery Charger&lt;/a&gt;. I bought this one because it can take regular AA batteries. I also bought an 8 pack of the Sanyo Eneloop batteries. This way I can use the charger twice before I have to find an outlet. It's also pretty compact. Unfortunately, AA batteries aren't the best way to charge an iPhone, only bringing it up 30-40%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second is a &lt;a href="http://amzn.com/B0073WV1UQ"&gt;Mophie Juice Pack&lt;/a&gt; for my iPhone. This one I almost always use anytime I know I'm not going to be near an outlet for an entire day. It will bring my phone up to about 60%. It's a little nicer than the USB chargers since I don't have to mess around with cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final device I use is the &lt;a href="http://amzn.com/B00AANQLRI"&gt;Jackery Giant 10400mAh Premium Portable High Capacity Dual-Port External Battery Power Bank Backup Charger&lt;/a&gt;. This thing can charge my iPhone several times and I've read that it will charge my iPad 3 once (I haven't had a chance to try that out). It is heavy though, and bulkier than the above mentioned devices. I always carry it in my bag though, and if I am going out with friends I'll grab it and a couple of cables so I can charge their phones too (although I don't have an Apple device that require a Lightning cable, so I can't charge those).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s. For the Great Ohio Bike Adventure back in June I bought the &lt;a href="http://amzn.com/B00828VFT2"&gt;AGPtek 5000mAh Solar Power Dual USB External Battery Pack and Charger&lt;/a&gt;. Although it does have two USB ports, one is for charging the battery. As a backup battery it worked fine, but the solar panel is basically on there for emergencies. After a full day of riding with it in the sun I could maybe get 5% charge onto my phone. That would be great if I was stuck somewhere and had to do a quick call or text, but I wouldn't buy it for it's solar panel.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="usb"></category><category term="battery"></category></entry><entry><title>Using an iPad with your reading workshop</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/11/09/using-an-ipad-with-your-reading-workshop/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-11-09T23:49:21-05:00</published><updated>2013-11-09T23:49:21-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-11-09:/2013/11/09/using-an-ipad-with-your-reading-workshop/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/top-teaching/2013/09/how-technology-can-support-and-enhance-your-reading-workshop"&gt;How Technology Can Support and Enhance Your Reading Workshop&lt;/a&gt; writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most of my planning, I started with the end in mind. I thought to myself, "What if students could jot their thinking down, in real time, and receive feedback without interrupting the workshop?" Even if they didn't receive feedback in the moment, could they at least jot their notes down to share at a more appropriate time? This is when I started using our reading notebooks in a more meaningful manner. I began to model "during reading" responses instead of only "after reading" responses. We began to use our notebooks in a more authentic way. After workshop, we would have rich, shared discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for everyone to have the opportunity to share would have taken too long. So, instead of having one child share at a time, I started utilizing partnership and small group sharing. This worked well, but not every child had the chance to grow from the group's thinking. I wished there was a way that each child had a chance to share their thinking with the whole group. This way, the odds of receiving specific feedback that would be most beneficial would be enhanced. The more minds working together, the better.  &lt;/p&gt;

They're very tedious to follow. Part of the blame is Twitter's fault. Why does my timeline show the newest posts at the top? To follow my time line, I have to read left to right, down, left to right, down, and then when I'm done with the tweet I move my eyes up to the next tweet. Totally unnatural, and exhausting. Or I could be getting old. I should say something about my lawn here...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are sites that try to alleviate this tedium. &lt;a href="http://tweetchat.com/"&gt;TweetChat&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite. The mobile site works well, and it automatically adds the hash tag. Unfortunately, it has two problems that make it less than perfect. The first is the bottom - up reading of tweets. The second is the lack of the ability to show conversations. Sometimes you want to know what started that rant during the Twitter chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/"&gt;TTYtter: an interactive console text-based command-line Twitter client and Perl platform&lt;/a&gt;. I run it under Linux and OS X, and I'm sure you could run it under Windows. Follow the directions on the site to get your account set up, and then quit it. I'll show you how to use it to follow a Twitter Chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, start it up with a few command line switches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ttytter.pl -ssl -ansi -readline -notimeline -dostream
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;-readline&lt;/em&gt; option may not work, you can leave it off for now. The important switch is the &lt;em&gt;-notimeline&lt;/em&gt; switch. This turns off your main timeline. Once you are in ttytter.pl, you can start tracking a hashtag by simply entering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;/#oetchat
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will start tracking that hash tag, it may take a few minutes before you start getting tweets. The tweets will come in prefaced with two characters. These characters are important! The tweets will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;b8&amp;gt; &amp;lt;OHSPRA&amp;gt; If you missed it, check out what happened tonight during the #oetchat that focused on blended learning. #OhEdChat
b9&amp;gt; &amp;lt;OhioEdTech&amp;gt; #OETchat Nov. 6, 2013: Blended Learning http://sfy.co/jVBn #storify #oetchat #oetc14
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To reply to a tweet, you'll use the command &lt;code&gt;/reply&lt;/code&gt; and the two character designation of the line you want to which you want to reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;/reply b8 This is a great chat! #ohedchat
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you have to manually add the hashtag. Other commands that you'll want to use are &lt;code&gt;/rt b8&lt;/code&gt; to retweet the above mentioned tweet and &lt;code&gt;/thread b8&lt;/code&gt; which will show the conversation that contains that tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, the best part? Tweets come in at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="twitter"></category><category term="hashtag"></category><category term="perl"></category></entry><entry><title>Ubiquitous opportunity</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/11/05/ubiquitous-opportunity/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-11-05T20:28:27-05:00</published><updated>2013-11-05T20:28:27-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-11-05:/2013/11/05/ubiquitous-opportunity/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.edudemic.com/real-time-technology-in-11-classrooms/"&gt;How To Use Real-Time Technology In 1:1 Classrooms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A concern about 1:1 programs I sometimes hear (and that I once held myself) was that students will always be “plugged in” and connected to a device. What seems to be happening on 6 Lime, though, is not ubiquitous use of devices. Instead, it is ubiquitous opportunity. Each teacher on this team has the option to make the best instructional choices each day, each class period. Each student on this team has opportunity for choice in his or her learning activity, growing awareness and taking greater responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love that term, &lt;em&gt;ubiquitous opportunity&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been battling the notion of "designing instruction for learning styles" in my own quixotic fashion for a couple of decades now. In my attempt to be a good steward of my clients' shareholders' equity I wished to help them avoid faddish instructional design practices that have been disproven by empirical research. I first learned back in the 1980s at NSPI (now ISPI) conferences that while self-reported learning style preferences do exist, that designing instruction to accommodate them has no basis.&lt;/p&gt;

The laptops, running Ubuntu, are already going to be managed with &lt;a href="http://puppetlabs.com/"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt;. This allows us to take care of all the settings, applications, etc. on the laptops in a central location. After talking to &lt;a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/users/908"&gt;Gary Larizza&lt;/a&gt; on IRC, he recommended using Hiera to manage the users on the individual machines. Today I think I have it licked, and these are my notes so I don't forget what I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very much a beginner with all this, how I'm doing it works for me but may not be the best way to do it. :-) First thing was to create the hiera config file, /etc/puppet/hiera.yaml (apparently you need to restart the puppet master after creating this file):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;---
:backends:
  - yaml
:yaml:
  :datadir: /etc/puppet/hieradata
:hierarchy:
  - nodeinfo
  - common
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then I created the test data file. Each computer record will be designated by the computer's serial number. Hiera will take serial number and find out which student is to be using the laptop. Puppet will then take this information to make sure the user is created. The nodeinfo file right now contains some test data (/etc/puppet/hieradata/nodeinfo.yaml) Password truncated to fit the screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;QP6220KLA4Q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;testuser&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;$6$eKwQ23ju$AdqZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;OXWZqK7xGSVKWz6yjpUti9nvMxRzqKmZ&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;H09362SF4PD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;testuser2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;$6$eKwQ23ju$AdqZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;OXWZqK7xGSVKWz6yjpUti9nvMxRzqKmZ&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally the user resource in puppet looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;nodeinfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt; = hiera(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;::serialnumber)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;user &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;nodeinfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;[&amp;#39;user&amp;#39;]:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;ensure  =&amp;gt; present,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;shell   =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;/bin/bash&amp;#39;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;managehome  =&amp;gt; true,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;password    =&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;nodeinfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;[&amp;#39;password&amp;#39;],&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I answered that most were beginners, and some were intermediate. Then I said that none were advanced. Do you know of any districts or schools in Ohio that are advanced with technology integration? Responding to comments I started to try to picture what advanced means. I guess at the basic level advanced means that students are creating more than consuming. Creating in this sense means more than just using an office suite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are other aspects of advanced? Maker spaces? Coding? Digital publishing and story telling? What else?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="edtech"></category><category term="integration"></category></entry><entry><title>Could BYOD Become a Job Requirement?</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/10/29/could-byod-become-a-job-requirement/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-10-29T20:22:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-10-29T20:22:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-10-29:/2013/10/29/could-byod-become-a-job-requirement/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.mobileenterprise360.com/blogs/paulkapustka/could-byod-become-job-requirement'&gt;Could BYOD Become a Job Requirement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel very strongly about the importance of learning from the past. In other words: not making the same mistakes again-and-again due to a lack of historical perspective. I was particularly inspired by Bret Victor's talk at the DBX conference, where he demonstrated a bunch of technologies from the 1970s which attempted to solve problems which we're still wrestling with today, and effectively asked the question 'Why haven't we figured this stuff out yet?', and more implicitly, 'Why are people who are working on these problems today unaware of this earlier work? Why have we gone backwards?'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is becoming more and more relevant as time goes on, except in the technology world it seems to go even faster! Web forums are terrible, even with &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/02/civilized-discourse-construction-kit.html"&gt;amazing people trying to fix it&lt;/a&gt;. Usenet News had online discussions solved 30 years ago, yet we're stuck &lt;a href="https://www.vbulletin.com/"&gt;with so many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.phpbb.com/"&gt;apps that&lt;/a&gt; are terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are Twitter chats. One of the most annoying uses of Twitter ever devised. There are &lt;a href="http://twubs.com/"&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://followblast.com/"&gt;devoted to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://tweetchat.com/"&gt;following&lt;/a&gt; hashtags to make the discussion more meaningful, but in the end, you're trying to force a piece of software to do something that it was never designed to do. IRC had group discussions solved 20 years ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What examples of solved problems do you know that are no longer solved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigating my issue, I would disable every extension, yet the problem continued. I couldn't find anything online about my particular problem. When logging into the profile for the first time, the freeze wouldn't happen until everything was synced. It was getting time to just delete that entire profile from Google and start anew. I didn't want to do that. Finally, as I was looking through the settings in Chrome, I noticed the link to manage my synced data in the Google dashboard. Upon clicking on the link, I noticed I had over 16,000 bookmarks in Chrome being synced! Apparently, in the past, I had used the Delicious extension to sync my Delicious bookmarks with Chrome. What had happened was that it had duplicated all my bookmarks several times. As soon as I deleted the errant folders of Delicous bookmarks, my Chrome profile stopped freezing!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="chrome"></category></entry><entry><title>Apple just killed the hackintosh</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/10/23/apple-just-killed-the-hackintosh/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-10-23T10:23:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-10-23T10:23:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-10-23:/2013/10/23/apple-just-killed-the-hackintosh/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple announced yesterday at their event that the newest version of OS X, version 10.9 (Mavericks), will be free to all Macintosh computers that can run it.

&lt;p&gt;But for hackintosh users, it means that there is no longer a way to purchase a legal copy of OS X. A hackintosh is a computer that is assembled out of parts that can be made to run OS X. It's a way to get a Mac without paying for a Mac. A lot of users of hackintosh like the challenge, like OS X, but for the most part Apple doesn't offer a hardware configuration for them. That ends now for those that try to stay as legal as possible, although a hackintosh was never quite legal. The OS X terms of service require OS X to be used on Apple labeled computers, which means even if you buy a copy it's still not quite legal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much innovation as the iPad may bring to the classroom, it's not going to replace a teacher anytime soon. In fact, the influx of technology like iPads means there is a greater need for teachers. We need teachers who are part early adopter, part integrator, and part mad scientist. The modern teacher must be willing to take chances and able to figure out how not just how technology works, but how it works for each student, and where its use is most appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zachary Loeb (who writes as the Luddbrarian on the blog librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com) notes that "although college students have a huge amount of information available to them, this does not automatically mean that they have acquired all of the information literacy necessary to really make sense of this mass amount of information. As a result the library staff becomes an increasingly important resource for students wading through the information glut, especially as library staff are often available to students in numerous ways (in person, e-mail, chat, by phone)." This is particularly true for adult learners who return to higher education after many years away from the classroom and who often find virtual research daunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libraries aren't going anywhere, but much like the saying "let's videotape that" now meaning to digitally record video, "let's go to the library" will mean something different.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="library"></category><category term="future"></category></entry><entry><title>#tlah Managing your class list in a spreadsheet, part 2</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/10/17/tlah-managing-your-class-list-in-a-spreadsheet-part-2/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-10-17T10:10:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-10-17T10:10:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-10-17:/2013/10/17/tlah-managing-your-class-list-in-a-spreadsheet-part-2/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we last visited our spread sheet, we used formulas to cut apart a list of names in our class that resulted in the following spreadsheet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Our great class" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/Classlistpart1final-l.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we will learn some more programming techniques in our quest to create another column in our spreadsheet which would have the students full name in the format &lt;strong&gt;Firstname Lastname&lt;/strong&gt;. To create this full name column, you might try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;=B2+C2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ugh, what's this &lt;code&gt;#VALUE!&lt;/code&gt; result? In this instance, it is because you tried to use the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operand on data which cannot be added. This means we need to talk about data types. We'll touch on two today, &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; (for those that know, a number data type can be a very complex beast, but we're trying to keep it simple!). A number data type is basically anything numeric. &lt;code&gt;19&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;87&lt;/code&gt; are two numbers.  We can add those two numbers and get &lt;code&gt;106&lt;/code&gt;. A string is a data type that can encompass letters, numbers, and symbols. &lt;code&gt;Luke&lt;/code&gt; is a string as is &lt;code&gt;I am your father&lt;/code&gt;. But, &lt;code&gt;19&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;87&lt;/code&gt; can also be strings, it just depends on what you want to do with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With strings, you don't add, you concatenate (yes, that's a real word, go look it up!). When you concatenate &lt;code&gt;Luke&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;I am your father&lt;/code&gt; you get &lt;code&gt;LukeI am your father&lt;/code&gt; (no space between &lt;code&gt;Luke&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; because the original strings don't have a space).  You can also concatenate &lt;code&gt;19&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;87&lt;/code&gt; to get &lt;code&gt;1987&lt;/code&gt;. The operand to concatenate is &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;. So for our example in Column D we will use the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; to concatenate the two fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;=B2&amp;amp;C2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Oh, so close! But now we have &lt;code&gt;LukeSkywalker&lt;/code&gt;, we want a space between them. To add the space, we just concatenate a &lt;code&gt;" "&lt;/code&gt; in between the two cell references:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;=B2&amp;amp;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&amp;amp;C2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And violà! We have a new column with the users &lt;code&gt;Firstname Lastname&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mygreatclass-firstname-lastname-l.png (640×292)" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/mygreatclass-firstname-lastname-l.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you write the formula to create a username which consists of the last two digits of the grad year, last name, firstname?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was once in New York, and I listened to a talk about the building of private prisons – a huge growth industry in America. The prison industry needs to plan its future growth – how many cells are they going to need? How many prisoners are there going to be, 15 years from now? And they found they could predict it very easily, using a pretty simple algorithm, based on asking what percentage of 10 and 11-year-olds couldn't read. And certainly couldn't read for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not one to one: you can't say that a literate society has no criminality. But there are very real correlations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting start, although the prison planning story appears to be an &lt;a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2010/03/prisons_dont_use_reading_score.html"&gt;urban myth&lt;/a&gt; without any &lt;a href="http://jamesshelley.net/2011/12/cite-the-source/"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But later Mr. Gaiman hits pay dirt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think there is such a thing as a bad book for children. Every now and again it becomes fashionable among some adults to point at a subset of children's books, a genre, perhaps, or an author, and to declare them bad books, books that children should be stopped from reading. I've seen it happen over and over; Enid Blyton was declared a bad author, so was RL Stine, so were dozens of others. Comics have been decried as fostering illiteracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's tosh. It's snobbery and it's foolishness. There are no bad authors for children, that children like and want to read and seek out, because every child is different. They can find the stories they need to, and they bring themselves to stories. A hackneyed, worn-out idea isn't hackneyed and worn out to them. This is the first time the child has encountered it. Do not discourage children from reading because you feel they are reading the wrong thing. Fiction you do not like is a route to other books you may prefer. And not everyone has the same taste as you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not just for the use of the word &lt;em&gt;tosh&lt;/em&gt;.  This needs to be shouted from the rooftops, posted in every school, said at every parent/teacher conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard that Ada Lovelace Day was coming, I questioned myself, “What do I actually know about Ada Lovelace?” The sum total of my knowledge: Ada was the first woman programmer and the Department of Defense honored her contributions to computation in 1979 by naming its common programming language Ada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Ada biographies later, I know Augusta Ada Lovelace to be an incredibly complex woman with a painful life story, one in which math, shame, and illness were continuously resurfacing themes. Despite all, Ada tirelessly pursued her passion for mathematics, making her contributions to computing undeniable and her genius all the more clear. Her accomplishments continue to serve as an inspiration to women throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet has replaced the importance of libraries as a repository for knowledge. And digital distribution has replaced the role of a library as a central hub for obtaining the containers of such knowledge: books. And digital bits have replaced the need to cut down trees to make paper and waste ink to create those books. This is evolution, not devolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Word is a tyrant of the imagination, a petty, unimaginative, inconsistent dictator that is ill-suited to any creative writer's use. Worse: it is a near-monopolist, dominating the word processing field. Its pervasive near-monopoly status has brainwashed software developers to such an extent that few can imagine a word processing tool that exists as anything other than as a shallow imitation of the Redmond Behemoth. But what exactly is wrong with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found, at both schools, that whenever I bring up the homework issue with teachers or administrators, their response is that they are required by the state to cover a certain amount of material. There are standardized tests, and everyone—students, teachers, schools—is being evaluated on those tests. I’m not interested in the debates over teaching to the test or No Child Left Behind. What I am interested in is what my daughter is doing during those nightly hours between 8 o’clock and midnight, when she finally gets to bed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi started life as an idea to bring computing in schools back to the era of the BBC Micro in the early 1980s, which inspired children to learn how a computer worked and allowed them to discover what was possible through learning to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What was needed was a return to an exciting, programmable machine like the old BBC Micro; and it had to be affordable, say around £20, so every child could potentially have one," explained Eben Upton co-founder of the Raspberry Pi at its launch. "Computing wasn't being seen as the exciting, vibrant subject it should be at school – it had become lacklustre and even boring."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been studying how we could use the Raspberry Pi in out classrooms. The lack of monitors with DVI or HDMI connectors have been a stumbling block, along with the lack of Flash and mediocre performance as a desktop. Although, that's not the role the Raspberry Pi was designed to fill, it would be a good entry into the classroom. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="raspberrypi"></category></entry><entry><title>Finding a school Chief Technology Officer is hard</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/10/09/finding-a-school-chief-technology-officer-is-hard/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-10-09T21:09:56-04:00</published><updated>2013-10-09T21:09:56-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-10-09:/2013/10/09/finding-a-school-chief-technology-officer-is-hard/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/10/02/06el-cto-side.h33.html?intc=EW-MDD13-EWH"&gt;Education Week: Talented Chief Tech Officers Hard to Find for K-12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why keeping up with the demands of the K-12 CTO's job can be difficult, because relatively few of these professionals are schooled in the perfect marriage of skills on the instructional and technical sides to make the best decisions for districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Humphrey, an emeritus professor at Cambridge University’s Darwin College, said he would have expected that reading generally would make people more empathetic and understanding. “But to separate off literary fiction, and to demonstrate that it has different effects from the other forms of reading, is remarkable,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although information technology products and services may be equally available, the innovative use of IT to create competitive differentiation has clearly been achieved y many organizations. What IT executives often lack is a contextual framework in which to explain the path to increasing value for their firms. The authors believe that this framework can be explained through the use of a needs hierarchy based on a comparison to the human psychological needs hierarchy described by Abraham Maslow more than sixty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

Not a problem, I thought. Copying the font to the machine would be easy. I went and mounted the disk image that contained the font, but when I tried to load it into &lt;a href="http://puppetlabs.com/"&gt;puppet&lt;/a&gt; (software that manages our machines), the file was zero bytes. I thought that was odd, so I started looking. The font was a .suit file, which, for those unfamiliar with the Mac world, designates it as a suitcase file which contains a bunch of fonts. Unfortunately, the fonts are stored in the resource fork, not the data fork. What? Forks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Brief history of Mac OS file systems&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, Mac files could consist of two parts. A data fork and a resource fork. On disk they are in one file, but the operating system uses them in different ways. The data fork stores unstructured data, such as the text in a word processing file. The resource fork stores structured data, like icons and embedded images. You know when you put a Windows formatted USB drive into a Mac and it creates an .AppleDouble folder? That's there to store any resource forks for files. Although most things stored their data in the data fork (and this is the part that gets copied to media that doesn't support resource forks), fonts are stored in the resource fork. When copied to a non-Mac formatted medium the resource fork and the font go off into never never land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Enter fondu&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fondu is a commandline application that extracts fonts to TrueType font files which can be used with most systems. I installed it with &lt;a href="http://brew.sh/"&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;brew install fondu
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once installed, I navigated to the folder with my .suit file in it and ran fondu on it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;fondu FONTFILE.suit
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And I was left with TrueType font files that I could easily distribute to the district's machines.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="fonts"></category><category term="mac"></category></entry><entry><title>Command line tool for Twitter</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/09/29/command-line-tool-for-twitter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-29T23:19:15-04:00</published><updated>2013-09-29T23:19:15-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-09-29:/2013/09/29/command-line-tool-for-twitter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sferik/t"&gt;sferik/t · GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The problems with technology becoming too difficult to use stems more from us wanting to do more with them than the year before. Look at the evolution of the iPhone. When it was released, there was no App Store, no cut and paste, no backgrounding. Apple has added those features over the last 6 years, at the expense of ease of use. Now users have to create and manage an Apple ID to use the App Store and learn how cut and paste works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers 30 years ago didn't have to network or support multiple users. Printers came with a printer driver for your various applications, not for the OS. Just because Lotus 123 was able to print didn't mean that WordPerfect was going to be able to print. Applications only ran one at a time. Now your computer operating system supports networking, printing and multiple users. Applications can run at the same time. With this progress brings complexity. Users have to know how to access networked resources and to manage users. They have to know how to navigate multiple applications running at the same time. In the 80s we had &lt;a href="http://www.magee.com/magee/Automenu.htm"&gt;Automenu&lt;/a&gt; and we liked it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adults have worn their computer illiteracy as a badge of pride for many years now so it shouldn't surprise anyone that their children share their digital inadequacies. Moreover, neither group is even willing to try to solve a problem when they encounter it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As recent privacy and malware issues have demonstrated, there is a price to be paid for computer illiteracy. And nobody should ever be proud of being ignorant. If not knowing something is a nonissue, then it's a nonissue, but don't brag about it.&lt;/p&gt;

At the beginning of the year I worked with our superintendent's secretary and others in the administration offices to create a workflow for new hires. This way we know exactly what has been and hasn't been done for new hires. &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArbGU358V1WJdHNnVXVQekMwWEdiY2M3RHQ1ZldMcXc&amp;amp;usp=sharing"&gt;Here is the worksheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Getting started&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArbGU358V1WJdHNnVXVQekMwWEdiY2M3RHQ1ZldMcXc&amp;amp;usp=sharing"&gt;Open the document&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;strong&gt;File -&amp;gt; Make a copy…&lt;/strong&gt; to make a copy of the Google Sheet. We use two worksheets, one for classified employees, one for certified. They are pretty much the same. Once you have the copy, you'll need to share the sheet with those that have tasks to be completed when new employees are hired. Have them double check their steps, adding or subtracting items if necessary. Be careful near the top under the superintendent secretary area, don't delete the two columns that list the various employees and whether they are finished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once everyone is satisfied with the steps, you'll need to update the formulas for each person in the &lt;strong&gt;Complete&lt;/strong&gt; column near the top of the screen. The current formula for the superintendent's secretary looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ARRAYFORMULA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ISBLANK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;B4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:B17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;No&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The range in the &lt;code&gt;ISBLANK()&lt;/code&gt; function represents the items for the superintendent's secretary to complete. The formula in this cell just checks to see if any of the items are blank, and if so, sets the value of the cell to &lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;. Update the ranges for each person to reflect their tasks listed in column A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all the items have a value, the formula returns &lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;.  Conditional formatting is turned on for these cells. If the value is &lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt; it sets the background to red. Once it says &lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt; the background is set to green. The formula only checks whether the item is blank, so feel free to put whatever you want in those cells for the items to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second sheet is a computer info sheet that the superintendent's secretary can print and give to the new hire. Modify it to suit your district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Procedure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a new employee is hired, the superintendent's secretary will open up the &lt;strong&gt;New Certified Staff Member Worksheet&lt;/strong&gt; and create a copy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name the worksheet with the new hire's name, for example, &lt;strong&gt;New Hire Worksheet, John Smith&lt;/strong&gt;. Be sure to check &lt;strong&gt;Share it with the same people&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;File -&amp;gt; Email collaborators…&lt;/strong&gt; to notify everyone that there is a new hire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete the worksheet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="googlesheets"></category></entry><entry><title>Why are you integrating technology?</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/09/23/why-are-you-integrating-technology/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-23T10:37:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-09-23T10:37:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-09-23:/2013/09/23/why-are-you-integrating-technology/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://georgecouros.ca/blog/archives/4125"&gt;School plus&lt;/a&gt; I have a new favorite quote for today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn't know, two new iPhones were released on the 20th to join the 4S. Since Apple has three iPhones, you may be wondering what's the difference, which one should I get. Here's what I think of the three models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The iPhone 4S&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phone isn't worth it even when given away for free with a two year contract. The technology is already two years old, which means that by the end of your contract it will be four years old, an eternity. How many people do you see walking around with an iPhone 3GS? And to add insult to injury, it only comes with 8GB.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The iPhone 5C&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen reviews where the writer raves on how good the plastic feels. It doesn't feel good, it feels cheap and plasticy. The technology is already a year behind, and the price difference of $100 isn't enough to justify  buying the 5C. (Over two years, that $100 difference is only $4.16 a month). It doesn't have the better camera of the 5S, or the 64-bit processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The iPhone 5S&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the phone with all the goodies. My usual recommendation when shopping for a smartphone is to buy the best phone they have. The out of pocket expenses is minuscule compared to the amount you are going to spend on your cell phone plan over the next two years. And you want to get your money's worth from your cellphone plan, don't you? The capabilities of the 5S make it easy to recommend. Another advantage is that in two years when your plan is up and you're ready to buy a new phone you'll be able to 2 to 4 hundred (depending on the color and size) out of the phone on eBay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really easy to recommend paying the $199-$399 for the iPhone 5S. In two years you'll still be able to get that amount for it on eBay for your next iPhone. The 5C is... I don't know why Apple released it. And an 8GB 4S is a joke. If you can only afford a free phone, buy the 5S, sell it on eBay for $600 and use the proceeds to buy a $250 4S. You'll make $350 out of the process and have a 4S with at least 16GB of space.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="iphone"></category></entry><entry><title>History teacher and class discover Boston's own Forest Gump</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/09/20/history-teacher-and-class-discover-bostons-own-forest-gump/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-20T18:14:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-09-20T18:14:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-09-20:/2013/09/20/history-teacher-and-class-discover-bostons-own-forest-gump/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2013/09/03/martin-w-joyce-the-briefcase/"&gt;The Briefcase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I'm supposed …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/1/4279674/im-still-here-back-online-after-a-year-without-the-internet"&gt;I’m still here: back online after a year without the internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year ago I left the internet. I thought it was making me unproductive. I thought it lacked meaning. I thought it was "corrupting my soul."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So did leaving the Internet fix Paul's ails?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I'm supposed to tell you how it solved all my problems. I'm supposed to be enlightened. I'm supposed to be more "real," now. More perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead it's 8PM and I just woke up. I slept all day, woke with eight voicemails on my phone from friends and coworkers. I went to my coffee shop to consume dinner, the Knicks game, my two newspapers, and a copy of The New Yorker. And now I'm watching Toy Story while I glance occasionally at the blinking cursor in this text document, willing it to write itself, willing it to generate the epiphanies my life has failed to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting that in this instance (and I'm sure it's the same for more people than not), Paul realizes that life is work. For most people, the Internet has made this work easier. Is this a good or bad thing? For now we don't know. The entire article is well worth the read!&lt;/p&gt;

For iOS there are apps such as Boxcar, Pushover, and App Notifications. These apps are nice and do the job, but they require a little more setup and/or they cost. As I was working on my iPhone for a replacement, I realized that the built in email app can have different notification types for each email account (such as sound, vibration, etc). So I started to play around, and set up a different Yahoo! account to use for notifications on my phone. My email accounts are set to silent, except for this new Yahoo! account and my VIP list. Now when I want to be notified right away, I use this email account. Under GMail I filter emails from various accounts and forward them to my new email account.

&lt;p&gt;Do parents of today hold some ideology of childhood that doesn't include electronics? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shared my theory with Kirkorian –that we parents might idealize a childhood without technology as better. “I often hear ‘grown ups’ talk about the inherent value of ‘real’ objects over technology,” she said, “but frankly I don't see a difference (and there's no research to suggest there is one) between a stick and an iPad. Of course kids should have time to explore the natural environment and interact with other people. A more realistic question is whether an hour or two of touch-screens per day is going to devastate permanently cognitive/social development. It's unlikely, but we just don't know yet, and any answer will depend heavily on program content and the characteristics of individual children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Your principal may need a list for various reasons, or you may want to email all the students in your class, or you may want to import your students into a new web service that you'd like to use. Now you could manage the list manually, creating the different formats one  student at a time. Or you could teach like a hacker and let a spreadsheet do all the hard work. My examples are going to use Google Sheets, but the concepts are the same in almost every spreadsheet. It's been awhile since I've used AppleWorks on an Apple //e, so I don't know how well these steps would work there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be assuming basic knowledge of spreadsheets in this tutorial. You'll need to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rows are labeled with numbers starting with 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Columns are labeled with letters starting with A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cells are referenced just like in the game Battleship. Cell &lt;strong&gt;A2&lt;/strong&gt; is in the first column, second row down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to assume you can use copy and paste to highlight your class list in your student information system software, copy, and paste it into a spreadsheet. Lets start by creating the spreadsheet. Go to Google Drive and create a new spreadsheet. Click on &lt;strong&gt;Untitled spreadsheet&lt;/strong&gt; in the upper left and name it &lt;strong&gt;My Great Class&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="NameSpreadsheet-m.png (320×148)" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/NameSpreadsheet-m.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first row put &lt;strong&gt;Full Name&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt; as column headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Column Headings-l.png (640×249)" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/Column%20Headings-l.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets make the column headings pretty. Click on the &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; in row one on the left to highlight the row. Then use the two formatting text icons to set the text color and background color. Then click the &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;old button for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pretty Columns-l.png (640×246)" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/Pretty%20Columns-l.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the class list we are going to use. You should be able to copy them from here and paste them right into the spreadsheet at cell &lt;strong&gt;A2&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Skywalker, Luke
Organa, Leia
Kenobi, Obi Wan
Vader, Darth
Solo, Han
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's a class list alright, but now we have a problem. How do we get the last name and first name without re-typing? We are going to use a &lt;strong&gt;function&lt;/strong&gt; (sometimessometimes referred to as a &lt;strong&gt;formula&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on your software). Click in &lt;strong&gt;C2&lt;/strong&gt;. You should be to the right of &lt;em&gt;Skywalker, Luke&lt;/em&gt;.  Looking at our list, we notice that there is a &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; after each last name. We can use that in our function to know where our last name ends. The function in Google Sheets that we are going to use is called &lt;strong&gt;LEFT()&lt;/strong&gt;. Functions take parameters, the little pieces of information that you want the function to work with. the &lt;strong&gt;LEFT()&lt;/strong&gt; takes one mandatory parameter and one optional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;LEFT(text,number)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The mandatory parameter is &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;, and it references the cell we will be working with. For &lt;strong&gt;Luke&lt;/strong&gt; that would be &lt;strong&gt;A2&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; parameter is how many characters to return, we'll leave it off first. You start entering a function with &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;. Let's try out the &lt;strong&gt;LEFT()&lt;/strong&gt; function. In &lt;strong&gt;C2&lt;/strong&gt; enter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;=LEFT(a2)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hit enter.  Looky there, we grabbed the &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; from Skywalker!! Parameters are separated in the function by a comma. Let's add another parameter to &lt;strong&gt;LEFT()&lt;/strong&gt;, and that is to tell it how many characters to grab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;=LEFT(a2,8)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hit enter. It grabbed the first 8 characters from cell &lt;strong&gt;A2&lt;/strong&gt;.  Now in a perfect world everyone's last name would have the same number of characters. Unfortunately, our world is much like a world a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. We need a way to find out the character position of the &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;. There is another function call &lt;strong&gt;SEARCH&lt;/strong&gt;. It will search through the text of a cell and return the position of the found text. In &lt;strong&gt;C2&lt;/strong&gt; try out this function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;=SEARCH(&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;,A2)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After hitting enter, &lt;strong&gt;C2&lt;/strong&gt; should contain the number 10, indicating that the comma is in the 10th position. Parameters in functions can also contain other functions, so we can use the &lt;strong&gt;SEARCH()&lt;/strong&gt; function in place of the second parameter in the &lt;strong&gt;LEFT()&lt;/strong&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;=LEFT(a2,SEARCH(&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;,A2))
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Oh, so close!!! It's returning the comma. We can use simple arithmetic to fix this, since the comma is one character, let's subtract them in the function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;=LEFT(a2,SEARCH(&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;,A2)-1)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Breaking down the second parameter, you have &lt;code&gt;SEARCH(",",A2)-1&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;SEARCH(","A2)&lt;/code&gt; is going to return the position of the comma, which we know with &lt;strong&gt;A2&lt;/strong&gt; is 10. The &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; subtracts one from the answer of the search function, leaving us in this example with 9. Congratulations, you now have cut out &lt;em&gt;Skywalker&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To copy the function to the other cells you're going to want to use &lt;strong&gt;fill down&lt;/strong&gt;. Select cell &lt;strong&gt;C2&lt;/strong&gt; if it isn't already selected.  Mouse over the square in the bottom right of the cell, and the cursor turns into a crosshair. Click and drag down to cell &lt;strong&gt;C6&lt;/strong&gt;. When you let up, it will fill in the cells with your function, automatically changing the references to reflect the row. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets go to &lt;strong&gt;B2&lt;/strong&gt; and work on the first name. We can't use the left function because it always starts at position 0. But we can use the &lt;strong&gt;MID()&lt;/strong&gt; function, which takes 3 mandatory parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;=MID(text,start,number)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We already know what to put in for the first two parameters. The text to find is the cell with the data, and in this case it's &lt;strong&gt;A2&lt;/strong&gt;. The start position is found by searching for the comma and adding 2. (Why 2? Remember, there is a space after the comma.) Our function starts to look like &lt;code&gt;=MID(A2,SEARCH(",",A2)+2,number)&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Number&lt;/em&gt; is the number of characters to return. We'll have to get tricky by using a new function call &lt;strong&gt;LEN&lt;/strong&gt; which calculates the length of the whole string and subtracting the position of the &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;. Our final function looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;=MID(A2,SEARCH(&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;,A2)+2,LEN(A2)-SEARCH(&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;,A2)+2)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Feel like a hacker yet? Let's break down the three parameters in that function!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;A2&lt;/code&gt;: This is the cell with the data we want to manipulate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;SEARCH(",",A2)+2&lt;/code&gt;: Find the position of the first comma and add two to skip over the comma and space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LEN(A2)-SEARCH(",",A2)+2&lt;/code&gt;: Take the length of &lt;strong&gt;A2&lt;/strong&gt; and subtract the position of the comma then add two to skip over the comma and space. This gives us the length of the string to return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Maybe it is the negative connotations that Hollywood has embedded into our culture on the term hacker that scares people away from it. I believe that the educational community should embrace &lt;em&gt;hacking&lt;/em&gt;.  Teach like a hacker does not mean going all Matthew Broderick in &lt;em&gt;Wargames&lt;/em&gt; and break into computers. I prefer the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(hobbyist)"&gt;Wikipedia hobbyist hacker definition&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In home and hobby circles, a hacker is a person who enjoys exploring the limits of what is possible, in a spirit of playful cleverness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of educational hacking came &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_23324450/san-jose-teachers-district-agree-landmark-contract"&gt;in the San Jose teacher contract that was unified in May&lt;/a&gt;. California state law requires that teacher evaluations include standardized testing, but since "There is no reliable study showing that increase so-called accountability by making student test scores a significant part of evaluation improves outcomes for students or teacher performance" "student performance will be part of the discussion on evaluations, teachers won't be penalized if students don't meet expectations." They followed the letter of the law by doing what is best for the students of the districts, evaluating and giving the district tools to hire and retain the best teachers available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or how about using &lt;a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome"&gt;Amazon Mechanical Turk&lt;/a&gt; to assist in grading? You could upload anonymized student work and pay someone to check for spelling and/or grammatical errors, allowing you to concentrate on the concepts. This is even easier for subjects with only one answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you used the phrase, "work smarter, not harder"? Hacking is working smarter. In simple terms, it is the act of working efficiently, allowing your students and yourself to be more effective. When I am tasked with completing something tedious, the first thing I think about is how I can automate it. Now, as you read this, you may be thinking, "Ryan, you're nuts! I don't have time to learn all this computer stuff." Hacking in the long run will save you time. It may take a little bit of time to set up, but over the long haul it pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is it worth the time?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Is it worth the time" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That chart really is an eye opener. You can spend up to 6 days (144 hours) automating a daily task that saves you 5 minutes a day and you will still save time over 5 years. One hundred and forty four hours is equivalent to over 3 and a half 40 hour work weeks. And that's just to automate something to save 5 minutes a day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What tedious tasks would you like to automate?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="tlah"></category></entry><entry><title>Post Apple event 9-10-2013 notes</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/09/11/post-apple-event-9-10-2013-notes/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-11T09:46:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-09-11T09:46:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-09-11:/2013/09/11/post-apple-event-9-10-2013-notes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So the latest Apple event happened.

I'm always a little disappointed in them. Maybe I put my expectations too high? Anyway, for schools, the big news is the inclusion of the iWork apps (Pages, Keynote, and Numbers) and two iLife apps (iMovie and iPhoto) now available for free with new purchases. Too bad they didn't include Garageband, but for schools looking at one to one programs with iPads this is an amazing deal. Right the start the students will have some powerful creation tools that have no equal on any other handheld or tablet device. The iPhone 5C and 5S sound pretty cool, but nothing in the "gotta have it" department. Not enough for me to update my iPhone 4 yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing else in my predictions were announced, although the iPhone 4S lives on. I'm hoping for new iPads in October, just in time for the holiday season. They'll probably be released, but will they be a good enough value against the Android tablets? I mean, the Android tablets have Minecraft too. I'm so tempted by the &lt;a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/nook-hd-plus-barnes-noble/1110060512"&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Nook HD+ Tablet&lt;/a&gt;. The screen is an amazing 1920x1280 resolution and at $149 it's half the price of an iPad mini. But then I would lose TweetBot, &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/2013/08/07/pythonista-programming-on-your-iphone-and-ipad/"&gt;Pythonista&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/2013/08/01/drafts-for-iphone-and-ipad-is-the-app-you-never-knew-you-needed/"&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one interesting piece in the event is the inclusion of a 64-bit processor in the iPhone 5S. There have been rumors circulating about Apple testing Macbooks Airs with ARM processors like those in the iPhones. Could the iPhone 5S be a stepping stone to these new laptops? A $499 Macbook Air with 24 hour battery life sounds pretty sweet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ios"></category><category term="ipad"></category><category term="iphone"></category><category term="apple"></category></entry><entry><title>iPhone 9-10-2013 Event Predictions</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/09/10/iphone-event-predictions/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-10T10:08:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-09-10T10:08:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-09-10:/2013/09/10/iphone-event-predictions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is the latest Apple iPhone event, a time when the Internet turns to all things Apple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next version of the iPhone will probably be announced, the iPhone 5S. Purported to be twice as fast as its predecessor the other redeeming feature will be the availablility of the 5S in a Champagne color. To combat the low end market for smartphones, Apple is rumored to also be coming out with the iPhone 5C. Because it will use a plastic case, it will be available in a wide range of colors. The iPhone 5, 4, and 4S will be retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A release date for iOS 7 will also probably be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Less likely to be announced&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A controlpad accessory for the iPhone and iPod touch to be released with iOS 7. This will allow games to take advantage of physical controls. Adding it to the AppleTV along with apps for the AppleTV could also be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Mac Pro shipping date could be announced, but that is a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What will probably not be announced&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New iPads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new iPod Touch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything with computers other than the Mac Pro&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Force quitting apps saves power and makes the phone run faster. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IOS devices can't multitask. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The onscreen keyboard is terrible. It never types correctly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can't create on iOS devices. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Force quitting apps saves power and makes the phone run faster&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you double-tap the home button on an iOS device, it will show you the recently used apps. Just because the app is in the list doesn't mean the app is running. Apple has all sorts of tricks to maximize battery life and speed of the device. For starters, except for certain types of apps (GPS and music apps), iOS will kill the app after 10 minutes no matter what. When you click on an app and it launches right where it was, it doesn't mean the app was running the entire time. Have you noticed that the app isn't responsive for the first few seconds? That's because the app wasn't running. iOS will tell an app when iOS is getting ready to kill the app. It is the app's responsibility to save what was happening. One of the things saved is a screenshot of the app. This screenshot is what is shown when you re-launch the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;iOS devices can't multitask&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it multitasks! Apple put several restrictions on what apps can and cannot do in the background to maximize battery life and speed of the device. Apps do run in the background for 10 minutes, and other factors can start up an app in the background (for example geofencing apps or VOIP apps). Music apps are also allowed to play music in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The onscreen keyboard is terrible. It never types correctly.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop trying to type correctly and let autocorrect do its thing. You may have to type proper names correctly a few times, but it learns pretty quickly these words. I've heard of people even turning off autocorrect! The autocorrect will usually get the words correct, even if you mangle them pretty badly. It will also correct previous words, for example when I type &lt;strong&gt;star wars&lt;/strong&gt; iOS will autocorrect it with the proper capitalization of &lt;strong&gt;Star Wars&lt;/strong&gt;. I miss autocorrect when I'm working on other computers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;You can't create on iOS devices.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This myth has been dying out in the last year, but it still persists. You can create documents with Pages, Google Drive, or Comic Life; presentations with Keynote; ebooks with Book Creator or Creative Book Builder; mobile websites with TouchAppCreator; music with Garageband; programming with Codea or Pythonista; and graphics/pictures with Paper by Fifty-Three, Procreate, or Sketchbook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite amazing what you can create now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future is about access, anywhere learning and collaboration, both locally and globally. Teaching and learning is going to be social. Schools of the future could have a traditional cohort of students, as well as online only students who live across the country or even the world. Things are already starting to move this way with the emergence of massive open online courses (MOOCs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the future of technology in education is the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infographic is much better than the article linked in the post to the Guardian. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of experiments run by researchers at Princeton, Harvard, and the University of Warwick, low-income people who were primed to think about financial problems performed poorly on a series of cognition tests, saddled with a mental load that was the equivalent of losing an entire night’s sleep. Put another way, the condition of poverty imposed a mental burden akin to losing 13 IQ points, or comparable to the cognitive difference that’s been observed between chronic alcoholics and normal adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been discussed that standardized testing is just a way to show the socioeconomic status of school districts. As shown in these experiments, the cognitive ability of people under poverty is limited due to the processing of the hardships that go along with poverty. It's not that the poor were of lower intelligence and that's why they are in poverty, but that becoming poor means their brains have to put forth effort that it didn't do before.&lt;/p&gt;

As we were talking, there was a point I wanted to make but I couldn't quite remember the information I wanted to use so I told him I "had to look it up". Of course, his reply was "What did you do before smartphones". It was at this moment I realized that the smartphone wasn't a crutch. If it wasn't for the smartphone, I wouldn't have know the information existed in the first place. I use my smartphone for making available to me the information that is available. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="memorization"></category><category term="google"></category><category term="search"></category></entry><entry><title>Group chats made easier with IRC</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/08/31/group-chats-made-easier-with-irc/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-31T11:41:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-08-31T11:41:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-08-31:/2013/08/31/group-chats-made-easier-with-irc/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's funny the cycles that tech goes through.

When the Internet was in its infancy, everything was as open as it could be. The protocols were all based on open standards, and your machine could talk to any other machine. Then came the online services of the 80s. Compuserv, AOL, Delphi, Prodigy. Each service trying to keep you in their own little world. Messages did not pass between the services for the most part. In the 90s with the creation of the world wide web things became more open again. THe juggernaut of AOL/Compuserv collapsed while the other services faded into obscurity. This lasted until the middle 00s with the popularity of social media services such as Facebook and Twitter. We are now moving back to the 80s where everyone wants to keep you on their service. Alas, that is a rant for another day…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are technologies that have been around to help minimize some of these influences. Today I'm talking about Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Created in 1988, IRC is a simple chat protocol that supports &lt;em&gt;channels&lt;/em&gt; (or rooms) and private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you get started, I've set up a chat room called #eduk8me on Freenode. To connect, you simply have to visit &lt;a href="http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23eduk8me&amp;amp;uio=d4"&gt;the Freenode web chat client&lt;/a&gt;. Create yourself a nickname, enter the captcha, and click &lt;strong&gt;Connect&lt;/strong&gt;. The channel field will already be filled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Freenode login" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/ConnectToFreenode-l.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to #eduk8me! Send me a private message saying hey! This will send me a notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;/msg mr_rcollins Hey!
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The simplicity of the protocol has some issues that we're not used to dealing with. The first is that there are no accounts. You can reserve your nickname though, so others cannot use it unless they have the password. Freenode has &lt;a href="http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#registering"&gt;a FAQ which deals with nickname registration&lt;/a&gt;. If you are just starting out you really don't need to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where this comes in handy is when you want to have a group chat. IRC doesn't require yet another user account and can scale pretty well. There are ways to do moderated chats too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out and tell me hi!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="irc"></category><category term="chat"></category></entry><entry><title>How to record touches and gestures for iOS screencasts</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/08/30/how-to-record-touches-and-gestures-for-ios-screencasts/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-30T10:36:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-08-30T10:36:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-08-30:/2013/08/30/how-to-record-touches-and-gestures-for-ios-screencasts/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight I was playing around with Assistive Touch on my iPhone.

In the Accessibility Settings, Assistive Touch places a "button" on the screen. This button gives the user access to certain capabilities, such as the ability to push a virtual &lt;strong&gt;home&lt;/strong&gt; button. Playing around tonight I went into the &lt;strong&gt;Favorites&lt;/strong&gt; area. This lets you record a gesture, with which you can play by pressing a button in this &lt;strong&gt;Favorites&lt;/strong&gt; area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in my playing around, I created my first gesture, which was just a tap. Once I added this saved gesture as a favorite I turned it on. Lo and behold, I had a blue circle on screen, which I could move around and when I released it showed tap. I then realized that one could turn this on when recording iPad or iPhone/iPod Touch screencasts and the taps would show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;, tap &lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt; and on the left, select &lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Accessibility" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/AssistiveTouch2013.08.29_3-m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;Physical and Motor&lt;/strong&gt;, tab &lt;strong&gt;Assistive Touch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Assistive Touch" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/AssistiveTouch2013.08.29_2-m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn on &lt;strong&gt;Assistive Touch&lt;/strong&gt; and then tab &lt;strong&gt;Create a new Gesture...&lt;/strong&gt;. To create the touch gesture, just tap. To save the gesture, tap &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt; in the upper right corner. Name it &lt;strong&gt;Touch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Create New Gesture" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/AssistiveTouch2013.08.29_0-m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Save Gesture" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/AssistiveTouch2013.08.29_1-m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now launch the app you want to record, tap the assistive touch button, select favorites and your newly created gesture, &lt;strong&gt;Touch&lt;/strong&gt;. A blue circle will follow your figure around the screen, showing a tap when you release your finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no other gestures work other than the current one selected. You also probably will want to create some sliding gestures, which would allow you to show a slide in the screencast. If you are switching gestures, you will probably want to cut out the selection of the gesture in your favorite movie editing application.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ios"></category><category term="screencast"></category><category term="howto"></category></entry><entry><title>Suspend Chrome tabs with The Great Suspender</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/08/29/suspend-chrome-tabs-with-the-great-suspender/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-29T10:11:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-08-29T10:11:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-08-29:/2013/08/29/suspend-chrome-tabs-with-the-great-suspender/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The newer versions of Firefox has a great feature where upon startup, web pages in tabs aren't activated until they are clicked on.

We settled on 11.6" laptops running Ubuntu as the device. The problem that has arisen is how to we ensure consistency with students who wish to bring their own laptop. If they were Chromebooks, the BYOD students could just run Chrome. But with the flexibility of Ubuntu comes the complexity for BYOD. That is, until one considers VirtualBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/"&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt; is a program that lets you &lt;strong&gt;virtualize&lt;/strong&gt; operating systems on your computer. For example, your computer (host)can be running Microsoft Windows, and run a virtual machine of Ubuntu Linux. The virtual machine (guest) is separate from your current system, anything in the virtual machine does not affect the host. The guest can even be running the same operating system, running Microsoft Windows in a virtual machine on a host running Microsoft Windows. There are some legal implications to running Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X in a virtual machine. For Microsoft Windows you will need to purchase an additional license for each copy of Microsoft Windows that you would run in a virtual machine. Under Mac OS X 10.8 you are allowed to virtualize up to 5 virtual machines on Apple hardware. Since we are looking at Ubuntu, these licensing restrictions don't affect us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Ubuntu, a standard image can be created with the exact same set up as the laptops. Even management of the virtual machine would be the same. So for our students and teachers, it won't matter whether or not they have a school laptop or their own laptop. Everyone will have the same setup. It's a brilliant solution to issues &lt;a href="http://stager.tv/blog/?p=2397"&gt;that have been brought up on BYOD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="byod"></category><category term="1to1"></category><category term="virtualbox"></category></entry><entry><title>Take control of your notifications</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/08/27/take-control-of-your-notifications/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-27T10:00:30-04:00</published><updated>2013-08-27T10:00:30-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-08-27:/2013/08/27/take-control-of-your-notifications/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Interruptions are deadly.

I've decided to take back the notifications on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First stop was the phone ringer. Apple doesn't have a silent ringtone on the iPhone, so I had to search. In my searching I came across the article &lt;a href="http://richardkmiller.com/702/iphone-tip-use-a-silent-ringtone-to-screen-calls-in-your-sleep"&gt;iPhone tip: Use a Silent Ringtone to Screen Calls in Your Sleep&lt;/a&gt;. It not only contained the silent ringtone but also directions on using it. My default ringtone is silence, and a different ringtone is set for those people for which my phone should always right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was text alerts. The iPhone has a silent text alert, so that part was easier than the ringtone. Then I also went in and added a tone for just a few people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I went into Settings -&amp;gt; Notifications and turned off the sound notifications for most of my applications. &lt;/p&gt;

Combine meetings with interruptions from students, parents, other teachers, and principals, and you have a recipe for grouchy teachers! A person takes 8-10 minutes to get back into a creative state following one interruption. Here are some ideas I had to help you minimize or eliminate interruptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students – Lay down rules on when a student is allowed to ask questions or contribute to a discussion. Create procedures for the student to follow to request help or use the bathroom. One idea to ask for help is to use a simple paper cup. If the cup is on the student’s desk or computer, he would like a moment of your time at your earliest convenience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parents – Notify parents when you are available, and distribute your e-mail address. Let them know they are free to e-mail you at any time. Keep the lines of communication open, but tell them that you are not available to take a call during the day. Sign up for a &lt;a href="http://google.com/voice"&gt;free Google voice account&lt;/a&gt; and give that number out to parents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teachers – A simple thing such as “If the door is closed, email me” can work wonders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Office – Notify the office that you check e-mail twice a day, and that it is your preferred method of communication. Along the same lines, be sure to check your e-mail twice a day!  Follow the idea for teachers above, and close the door when possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Ideas – The best line of defense is a good offense. Let others know what interruptions are acceptable to you. You have e-mail, use it to eliminate as many interruptions as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is to put you in control of your interruptions, and let you take care of them when you have time. Everything above is workable (except for emergencies).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="interruptions"></category><category term="creativity"></category><category term="classroommanagement"></category></entry><entry><title>Pythonista, programming on your iPhone and iPad</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/08/07/pythonista-programming-on-your-iphone-and-ipad/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-07T10:42:48-04:00</published><updated>2013-08-07T10:42:48-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-08-07:/2013/08/07/pythonista-programming-on-your-iphone-and-ipad/</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like a teenager again while playing around with &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pythonista/id528579881?mt=8"&gt;Pythonista (Universal, $6.99)&lt;/a&gt;, an app for iOS allows you to program in python directly on the device. It reminds me a lot about when I was learning to program in BASIC on my Atari 800XL (my favorite computer ever, although my iPod Touch is a close second). With Pythonista, I can finally write little apps to make my day easier. A lot nicer than going to the App store, downloading a bunch of free apps, all which have obnoxious ads and don't do quite what I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first script was written to automate my 365 project. A project that I am terrible at keeping up, but now my DOY script will make it easier when I post once a month. I always struggle with the text I add at the end of my description for the picture, where I calculate the day of the year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#365 (218/365)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'd end up having to go to a website to find out what the day of the year it was. Well, at least that's what I did in the past. Now I have written the following script and created a &lt;a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/shortcut/"&gt;shortcut to it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# We&amp;#39;re going to need work with dates, access to the clipboard,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# and to launch an app (you use the webbrowser to do that).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;clipboard&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;webbrowser&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Figure out the day of the year&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;day_of_year&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timetuple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tm_yday&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Create out tag line&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;clip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; #365 (&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;day_of_year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;/365)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;clipboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;clip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Open Camera+&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;webbrowser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;cameraplus://&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Camera+ has a shoot and share mode, which is what I have set as the default. So now I click on the DOY icon, Pythonista does its thing and Camera+ opens up. I take the picture, type my witty caption, and paste the tagline. Very, very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pythonista can also export your script as an XCode project, one that you can load into XCode and create an actual iOS app. I haven't had the chance to try that out yet. A couple of negatives. Getting scripts into Pythonista can be a lesson in patience. Due to Apple's limitations on loading code, you cannot simply load code from your Dropbox or other sources, you have to copy and paste. This also means that scripts on your iPhone are automatically synced to your iPad. There is a Dropbox workaround, but I haven't had the chance to try it out yet. The other negative that I've found so far is that there isn't a built in user interface library, so you're limited to text or creating your own graphics for things like buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it's well worth the price (especially since it's universal!).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ios"></category><category term="iphone"></category><category term="ipad"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="pythonista"></category></entry><entry><title>Drafts for iPhone and iPad is the app you never knew you needed</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/08/01/drafts-for-iphone-and-ipad-is-the-app-you-never-knew-you-needed/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-01T19:38:51-04:00</published><updated>2013-08-01T19:38:51-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-08-01:/2013/08/01/drafts-for-iphone-and-ipad-is-the-app-you-never-knew-you-needed/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On its surface, Drafts appears to be yet another note taking app for iOS.

&lt;p&gt;Once you've finished typing your note is when the magic begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drafts has a bunch of built in actions, which allow you to process your note in various ways. The simplest actions do things like save your note to Evernote, or use your note as an email. You can also Tweet your note. I've found the Dropbox actions to be very powerful. You can apply templates to your note. For example, my blog posts while I'm working on them have a distinct format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2013&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;01&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;rcollins&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Software&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;great&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To create a new post in Drafts, I start a new note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;This is the title of the post
Category: Software
Tags: some,great,tags

This is the body of the blog post
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I am finished with the note, I use a Drafts Action to save to my drafts folder in Dropbox. The action names the file by the first line in the note, appending a .markdown extension. It then creates the rest of the formatting through the following template before saving it to Dropbox:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Title: [[title]]
Date: [[date|%F %T]]
Author: mr.rcollins
[[body]]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/draftssavedraft-m.jpg" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/blog/draftssavedraft-m.jpg" title="Dropbox save draft action"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I have the blog post formatted correctly. I do have two complaints with the program. The first is that it uses it's own sync service instead of Dropbox or iCloud. The second is more of a pet peeve, the app isn't universal, so I ended up paying for the iPad and iPhone version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's now such an integral part of how I work that I put it in my dock, alone, not in a folder of apps. I use it to send tweets, create emails, start blog posts, and append to notes in Dropbox. The price ($2.99 for iPhone, $3.99 for iPad) was worth it to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="drafts"></category><category term="ios"></category><category term="automation"></category></entry><entry><title>"Well, better get unconventional." -- Dr. Ballard</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/07/22/well-better-get-unconventional-dr-ballard/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-07-22T13:21:17-04:00</published><updated>2013-07-22T13:21:17-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-07-22:/2013/07/22/well-better-get-unconventional-dr-ballard/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Well, better get unconventional." -- Dr. Ballard&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Well, better get unconventional." -- Dr. Ballard&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Is there anything like Drafts for iOS for Android?</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/07/20/is-there-anything-like-drafts-for-ios-for-android/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-07-20T11:13:49-04:00</published><updated>2013-07-20T11:13:49-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-07-20:/2013/07/20/is-there-anything-like-drafts-for-ios-for-android/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is there anything like Drafts for iOS for Android?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is there anything like Drafts for iOS for Android?&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>My work is done</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/07/19/my-work-is-done/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-07-19T19:01:27-04:00</published><updated>2013-07-19T19:01:27-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-07-19:/2013/07/19/my-work-is-done/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The daughter knows who Notch is.

&lt;li&gt;Read three novels: &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt;.

There really isn't any particular reason for reading these, except for the fact that two of them have movies in 2013.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write an interactive fiction game in Inform 7. Interactive fiction may be somewhat of a dead genre but I think it's a fascinating way to create a story.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get my point. Should is really a useless word – it implies that there’s a better way to do something, and you’re not doing it. It also places blame – either on yourself or on someone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It puts the focus on what you’re not doing instead of all the things you are doing. Not recognizing your successes and achievements keeps you on quest to fulfill impossible standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Embrace the box&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ransomtech.edublogs.org/2013/05/29/embrace-the-box/"&gt;Stephen Ransom shares a TED video&lt;/a&gt; in which he reflects on how teachers use limitations as a reason not to do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This font came up on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RichLewis007/status/341935394746667010"&gt;Twitter from RichLewis007&lt;/a&gt;. It's a font like Wingdings, but with icons like you see in apps and on websites. It would make a great addition to your computer, especially if you are creating help sheets for students or teachers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="teaching"></category><category term="fonts"></category><category term="creativity"></category><category term="limitations"></category></entry><entry><title>A PirateBox to call my own</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/06/05/a-piratebox-to-call-my-own/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-05T19:28:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-06-05T19:28:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-06-05:/2013/06/05/a-piratebox-to-call-my-own/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a couple of weeks I will be taking part in the Great Ohio Bike Adventure (GOBA), a week long bike ride through several towns in Ohio.

As I was planning on how to power everything, somehow I was reminded of the PirateBox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://daviddarts.com/piratebox/?title=PirateBox"&gt;PirateBox&lt;/a&gt; is a self contained hotspot that runs a webserver, allowing anyone within range to connect to it and upload or download files. It also has a chat box on the front page for simple chatting needs and a simple image board. The PirateBox grew out of David Darts need to share files with his classes at NYU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first stumbled upon the idea either from &lt;a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2011/06/01/piratebox-storybox/"&gt;Alan Levine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/01/piratebox-an-artistic-provocation-in-lunchbox-form/"&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt; and promptly forgot about it. With low cost computers easily accesible, I thought, why not make a PirateBox for GOBA and see what happens. As I was planning to order a Raspberry Pi (most PirateBoxes are made with a wireless router, but I like doing things the hardway) I was reminded of my &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/MK802-Android-Google-Player-Allwinner/dp/B008BFXOZE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1370475494&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=mk802"&gt;Mini MK802 Android 4.0 &lt;/a&gt; that I already had. Here was a computer a little larger than a pack of gum with 1GB of RAM and wifi. I installed &lt;a href="http://romanrm.ru/en/a10/debian"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; on it (requires a network adapter since you have to use SSH to control it) and then used &lt;a href="http://piratebox.aod-rpg.de/dokuwiki/doku.php/piratebox_lighttpd"&gt;these directions&lt;/a&gt; to finish setting it up. On caveat, you have to apt-get install python since that isn't in the Debian image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a restart, it didn't show up as a hotspot, so I started digging and came across &lt;a href="http://blog.sip2serve.com/post/38010690418/raspberry-pi-access-point-using-rtl8192cu"&gt;these directions on setting up an access point on a Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;. After I replaced the hostapd program with the one from the website and changed the /opt/piratebox/conf/hostapd.conf config file to match the directions, the PirateBox was in business. I also added a 16GB flash drive for shared file storage. It's formatted FAT32 so I can easily update it from my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been carrying it around with me, although I don't think anyone has connected to it that I hadn't told yet. On my trip to Cedar Point I'll be bringing it along to see what bored people standing in line will do with it. It currently has some creative commons works on it (Cory Doctorow book, some Jonathan Coulton songs) and I'll need to load more before I go. One problem that I have with it is that as soon as I leave wifi, my iPhone latches onto the PirateBox and then nothing works. I end up turning off wifi for now, at least until I come up with a better idea. One other thing I need to do is come up with a better name. I can't have PirateBox showing up in the wifi settings when I'm in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm brainstorming what else I can do with it. I have a 1GHz machine with 1GB of RAM (it's only using 56MB of RAM) running in my pocket at all time. What neat things can I do with it?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="piratebox"></category><category term="mk802"></category><category term="debian"></category></entry><entry><title>Dictionary of numbers Chrome extension helps the understanding of large numbers</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/05/28/dictionary-of-numbers-chrome-extension-helps-the-understanding-of-large-numbers/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-28T22:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-05-28T22:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-05-28:/2013/05/28/dictionary-of-numbers-chrome-extension-helps-the-understanding-of-large-numbers/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dictionaryofnumbers.com/"&gt;Dictionary of Numbers&lt;/a&gt; is a neat extension for Google's Chrome browser that gives you examples of large numbers in terms that could be easier to visualize.

When you have an itch, you scratch it. By using my Linux box at home (you could use an OS X machine also) and Dropbox, I can now schedule posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Prequisites&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my server I set up Dropbox. There is a script on the Dropbox site that allows you to set it up on &lt;strong&gt;headless&lt;/strong&gt; servers (a server without a monitor, keyboard, or mouse). In my DropBox folder, I created a folder called &lt;strong&gt;ToPost&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The script&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll need to adjust the path to &lt;em&gt;TOPOST&lt;/em&gt; and to the &lt;em&gt;SITE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;TOPOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;~/Dropbox/Elements/RyanCollins.org/ToPost/*.markdown
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SITE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;~/Development/ryancollins.org

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;shopt&lt;/span&gt; -s nullglob

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;YEAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;date +%Y&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;NOW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;date +&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; file in &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;TOPOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;DATELINE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;cat &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; grep &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;^Date: &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DATELINE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;#* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;NOW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
        mv &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SITE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/content/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;YEAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SITE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        make rsync_upload
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Scheduling&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the command prompt, run crontab with the -e parameter so we can add a scheduled job:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ryan@serverbot:~$ crontab -e
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and add a line to our script to run it every 15 minutes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;*/15    *   *   *   *    /home/ryan/Development/ryancollins.org/dbupdate.sh

&lt;li&gt;Don't you feel like you're on a device all the time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your secretary available?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wes had several examples of where his secretary took the initiative and created Google Sheets documents to make her job easier. Pretty impressive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This was a very cool session. A lot of complaints I hear about Google Docs is that fact that it's hard to lay things out in the document.

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, this is obviously a student that values his education and is tired of doing worksheets. Could he have handled it better? Probably. In the follow up video it shows that he is thirsty for knowledge and wants something better for his life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see how the school deals with the situation. What other ways could the student have expressed himself?&lt;/p&gt;

Looking back at the first incarnations from 2003 shows a site that reminds me a lot of current day Facebook and Twitter. An example of my words of wisdom from 2003:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And tonight marks the end of a great TV series that it seemed like nobody was watching. Buffy the Vampire Slayer ends its seven season run with the episode "Chosen".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that this series never got the recognition it deserved, with such great episodes like Hush and Once more with Feeling, the creator Joss Whedon was never afraid to totally change your perception of characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least Angel will be back this fall, and I've been buying the Buffy DVDs. The plan is to watch Season 2 this fall on Tuesday nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I now own the entire series of Buffy on DVD, just in case you were worried)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days I was running Postnuke, and apparently by 2005 I had switched over to Wordpress, which I had used up until last month. I have nothing against Wordpress, and for a majority of users, Wordpress is the way to go. For myself, I was getting tired of administrating the site more than writing and I wanted more speed without jumping through a bunch of hoops. So last month I switch to &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is a website generator written in Python. The difference between something like Wordpress and Pelican is that Wordpress parses each web page as a user views it while Pelican generates the site ahead of time as html pages that can be uploaded anywhere. This means I can host my website any place that supports static web pages. I'm currently using a virtual private service (VPS) to host my website. When I'm tired of administrating my VPS, I can easily switch to publishing on Amazon S3. Other options include the &lt;em&gt;Public&lt;/em&gt; folder in Dropbox or in Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of Pelican I really like is the ability to check my entire site into version control (git in my case). With version control, I can easily work on new branches of the site without disturbing the current site. And, if you're bored, you can &lt;a href="https://github.com/mrrcollins/ryancollins.org"&gt;fork the repo of the site at Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My comments were already switched over to Disqus, and I was able to mimic the same urls from Wordpress in Pelican. This allowed me to use my Disqus comments as is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two pieces that I need to work on. One is to set up some way to schedule posts, and the other is a theme that's not the default. Oh, I also need to go through all my old posts and fix the categories. Wordpress allowed multiple categories per post, Pelican does not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="geek"></category></entry><entry><title>Linux for 1:1 instead of Chromebooks or iPads</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/04/11/linux-for-11-instead-of-chromebooks-or-ipads/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-04-11T16:50:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-04-11T16:50:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-04-11:/2013/04/11/linux-for-11-instead-of-chromebooks-or-ipads/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;(This post is basically me thinking out loud...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/saigonubuntulinux10.jpg"&gt;Like many districts, my district is looking at devices for a 1:1
program. The top three devices seem to be Chromebooks, iPads, Windows or
OS X laptops. Costs are the main driving factor for a lot of districts,
which basically means they are choosing between Chromebooks or iPads.
While these devices have their uses, I'm wondering why we aren't looking
at Linux laptops (probably running Ubuntu). There are districts with
districts with Linux laptops, with &lt;a href="http://ubermix.org/"&gt;Ubermix&lt;/a&gt; being pretty prevalant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubermix has some neat features, the most important one is the ability
for a student to re-set their laptop on their own &lt;a href="http://ubermix.org/basics.html"&gt;with quick
recovery&lt;/a&gt;. In my mind, I'm thinking of extending this function along
with what I've learned from my &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/2013/03/13/re-purpose-old-machines-as-chrome-browser-boxes-introducing-the-gozbrowserbox/"&gt;GozBrowserBox project&lt;/a&gt;. I would
probably use the idea of Ubermix but with a straight Ubuntu install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each laptop would be set up to use &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.com/"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt; in a serverless manner for
management and the student's home folder would be synced to a Network
Attached Storage device. The Puppet manifests would be synced and ran at
startup, and the home folder syncing would happen only at log in and log
off. Both of these to minimize any bandwidth issues. I haven't quite
figured out how to do user management. It could be done with Puppet for
1:1 managed machines, and use our current directory for shared devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setup would be very, very powerful. Not only could they do
everything a Chromebook could do, but they would give the students
access to software that's not available on the web. This is a very
important consideration for students in 7th grade and lower, since most
websites limit usage by those under the age of 13. Management becomes a
non-issue with a quick recovery setup and Puppet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost per device would be between $300-$350 (without case). Comparable
Chromebooks cost $280-$310 with Google Management, and the iPad mini
starts at $329 (but can't be used with the PARCC tests, so you really
need to start at $399).&lt;/p&gt;

is a set of scripts that will take an Ubuntu installation and set up a full
screen browser box. It works very well
with lower end machines and makes them more useful. There are three
configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standalone: For Intel machines with at least 512MB of RAM, this
    configuration will set up the machine to launch Chrome full screen
    running on the local machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser server: For Intel machines with a couple GBs of RAM, this
    configuration sets up the machine like the standalone machine above,
    but also allows remote access for clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser client: For PowerPC machines (like eMacs, iBooks, etc) or
    Intel machines with at least 256MB of RAM (it may work with less, I
    haven't had a chance to test it). This configuration requires some
    network configuration to resolve the machine name &lt;em&gt;browser&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three configurations use Chrome to it's fullest, including Flash and
sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main cornerstones of education is sharing. What one teacher
or student creates is freely shared with others, for the benefits of the
system. Unfortunately, Prince George is currently review a policy that
would assign all work completed by teachers and students to the
district. From what I understand about copyright, teacher work could
conceivably fall under &lt;em&gt;work for hire&lt;/em&gt;, which means the school district
could assert this ownership. But should they? For students the legality
is a bit murky. Since the students do not work for the district, it
would be a stretch to believe that the district could assert copyright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bosses are a dime a dozen. Leaders can be one in a million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of another quote I've read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do things for your boss because you have to, you do things for a
leader because you want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week I will be attending my 15th (I think) &lt;a href="http://www.etech.ohio.gov/conference"&gt;Ohio eTech Technology
Conference&lt;/a&gt; (OETC). Over the years I've learned a few things. Ignore
the vendor presentations, flip through the vendor hall quickly for free
swag, talk to the students that are presenting, attend teacher
presentations, network and discuss with others. My goal is to learn one
new thing, and I usually succeed. That being said, does the time
allotment make learning that "one new thing" worth it? Of all the items
I mentioned above, the free swag from vendors is the only thing I can't
do virtually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time there is a presentation on a topic I'm interested, I've
already researched the topic, visited websites, watched videos. Once the
conference rolls around, I will attend presentations, take notes, ask
questions, and hopefully I'll come away with some insight or piece of
information that I didn't get online. More often than not this doesn't
happen (thankfully, the number of bullet point presentations has gone
down immensely!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year a hot topic is Blended Learning, the combination of
face-to-face instruction with online instruction. A relatively new term,
&lt;em&gt;Blended Learning&lt;/em&gt; is continuing the flipped classroom model, which
really took off with the Salman Khan and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_academy"&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;. The irony
of &lt;em&gt;Blended Learning&lt;/em&gt; being the main topic of the first day of OETC is
the fact that most of what OETC is could be delivered online. Looking
through the &lt;a href="http://schedule.etech.ohio.gov/?s=blended+learning"&gt;Schedule&lt;/a&gt; searching for &lt;em&gt;blended learning&lt;/em&gt; didn't bring
up any sessions that actually demonstrate blended learning. And by
demonstrate, I mean that they don't give resources for a participant to
use before the session so they can come into the session informed and
ready. Instead, these sessions will more than likely be a lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a chance for something amazing to happen this year. On Tuesday
the first &lt;strong&gt;Un-conference&lt;/strong&gt; will take place, &lt;a href="http://oetcx.com/"&gt;OETCx&lt;/a&gt;. Ohio eTech is
supplying several rooms for a totally different take on what a
conference could be. I'm excited and will be a total hypocrite for what
I said above. I will be doing an &lt;em&gt;ignite style session&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://oetc2013.sched.org/event/7c632c93aa88881a439282a6771e79f9#.URBkV6uDSiY"&gt;OETCx
Encienda&lt;/a&gt; where I will have 5 mins and 20 slides to tell a story. I'm
also on a panel called the &lt;a href="http://oetc2013.sched.org/event/d84d98c761ba662e3964638847855f0d#.URBkYKuDSiY"&gt;OETCx App Smackdown&lt;/a&gt;. I'm excited to be a
part of OETCx and to have the chance to push forward what conferences
could be like.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>❂ Andre Cassagnes, Creator Of The Etch A Sketch, Dead At 86</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/02/04/andre-cassagnes-creator-of-the-etch-a-sketch-dead-at-86/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-02-04T13:43:00-05:00</published><updated>2013-02-04T13:43:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-02-04:/2013/02/04/andre-cassagnes-creator-of-the-etch-a-sketch-dead-at-86/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/04/andre-cassagnes-creator-of-the-etch-a-sketch-dead-at-86/"&gt;?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is EduCon?&lt;br&gt;
 EduCon is both a conversation and a conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an innovation conference where we can come together, both in
person and virtually, to discuss the future of schools. Every session
will be an opportunity to discuss and debate ideas — from the very
practical to the big dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Videos of Educon sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/educon204"&gt;All of the sessions are available to watch on Youtube!&lt;/a&gt;. Try not to
be overwhelmed by the number of videos, just take one a day/week/month.
A great resource for an edchat in your school district and a glimpse
into how learning takes place in other schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Preaching to the #educhoir Really DOES Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written about the &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/2011/11/30/beware-of-the-echo-chamber/"&gt;echo chamber&lt;/a&gt; before and the perils therein,
but Bill Ferriter writes how sometimes &lt;a href="http://teacherleaders.typepad.com/the_tempered_radical/2013/01/preaching-to-the-educhoir-matters.html"&gt;you need the echo chamber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Apple Lisa. While the Apple //e had profound effects on the computer
world throughout the 80s, I am in awe of how much the Apple Lisa
foretold of the computing world. No matter what your thoughts are of
Steve Jobs, the man had a knack for going "&lt;a href="http://www.complex.com/tech/2012/10/steve-jobs-quotes/move-toward-the-goal"&gt;where the puck is going to
be, not where it has been&lt;/a&gt;". Reading through &lt;a href="http://dl.ryancollins.org/BYTE%20Lisa%20Review%20-%20Feb%201983.pdf"&gt;BYTE magazine review of
the Apple Lisa&lt;/a&gt; shows what Steve was envisioning. It seems so quaint
how the writer had to describe using the "mouse", what the "desktop"
was, and how to double-click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Lisa was a failure in the marketplace and its document
centric model being bypassed by an app centric model, it did set the
stage for the direction of computers over the next 30 years. BYTE
magazine, the world's second personal computer magazine, started
publication in 1975 as a platform agnostic magazine. The Lisa was so
different that the reviewer didn't quite know how to review the
computer, and, in fact, foresaw the end of the megahertz race and the
death of computer specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting on the technical specifications of a computer toward the end
of an article is unusual for BYTE, but it emphasizes tha the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; of
Lisa is more important than the what. For part of the market, at
least, the Lisa computer will change the emphasis of microcomputer
from "How much RAM does it have?" to "What can it do for me?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lisa also had a sleep feature, much like hibernate under Windows and
how iOS on the iPhone and iPad react to sleeping and waking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... thing happens when you turn the Lisa "off" (actually, it's never
completely off; it just goes into a low-power mode). In any case, when
you hit the Off button, system software automatically closes all open
files, thus transferring the information in them to their respective
floppy disks, and releses the disks from the Lisa disk drives. In
addition, the software records the status of the "desktop" so that,
when the computer is reactivated, Lisa automatically returns it to the
appearance and state it was in when the Lisa was turned "off".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that when people try to predict the future there are only two
different scenerios. The more likely gradual changes, and the so far out
there changes that the chance of them being right is slim and
unbelievable. The Lisa shows that Apple was the latter, and it amazes me
what they were thinking up in the years leading up to its release. Apple
did get inspiration on the GUI from Xerox Parc, but their additions,
such as pull-down menus, overlapping windows, are the excence of Apple,
refinement of an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xerox PARC’s innovation had been to replace the traditional computer
command line with onscreen icons. But when you clicked on an icon you
got a pop-up menu: this was the intermediary between the user’s
intention and the computer’s response. Jobs’s software team took the
graphical interface a giant step further. It emphasized “direct
manipulation.” If you wanted to make a window bigger, you just pulled
on its corner and made it bigger; if you wanted to move a window
across the screen, you just grabbed it and moved it. The Apple
designers also invented the menu bar, the pull-down menu, and the
trash can—all features that radically simplified the original Xerox
parc idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between direct and indirect manipulation—between three
buttons and one button, three hundred dollars and fifteen dollars, and
a roller ball supported by ball bearings and a free-rolling ball—is
not trivial. It is the difference between something intended for
experts, which is what Xerox PARC had in mind, and something that’s
appropriate for a mass audience, which is what Apple had in mind. PARC
was building a personal computer. Apple wanted to build a popular
computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we are, 30 years later. A half billion iOS devices have been
sold, and more people than ever have more computing power in their
pocket then what was used to put a man on the moon. Apple now generates
almost as much revenue in a quarter than Microsoft does in a year. With
$137 billion in the bank, what do they have planned for the future?&lt;/p&gt;

is the technology that everyone loves to hate. They use it daily, and most hate
every minute of it. I believe part of the problem
is the difficulty in coming up with a workflow that allows you to
efficiently use email. And by efficiently use email, I mean that whether
you are on your computer, a tablet, or smartphone, you can organize your
email and do work with the device you have with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years I've been refining how I use email. The
problem is how to organize your email in such a way that allows you to
not miss important emails or tasks that need to be completed, but to
also provide quick responses to emails you are sent. The workflow I've
come up with I call &lt;strong&gt;DART&lt;/strong&gt;: Delete, Archive, Reply or To do. It's a
very GMail centric workflow, but can easily be adapted to whatever email
system you use. The beauty of it is that your inbox is always empty, and
any emails that need further action are in the folder &lt;em&gt;To Do&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;DART&lt;/strong&gt;
refers to actions taken with new emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Delete&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty self explanatory, the trick is to know what to delete and what to
not delete. I basically only delete SPAM messages that have gotten past
the SPAM filter or sales messages of which pertains to things outside of
my area. Deleting messages is in actuality a task that does not take
very often because &lt;em&gt;Archiving&lt;/em&gt; makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Archive&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you archive a message in GMail, it takes the message out of your
inbox and places it in All Mail. You can mimic this action with other
email services, just create an All Mail folder and move messages into
it. To locate messages a person will use search instead or organizing
emails into folders or labels. Sometimes it makes sense to put things
into folders instead of just All Mail, but in a majority of situations
it takes more time to organize your email into folders instead of just
putting them into All Mail and using search to locate your messages.
GMail provides search tools such as &lt;em&gt;from:&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;to:&lt;/em&gt; to help locate
messages from or sent to particular people. Most of the email messages I
receive are archived because they do not warrant a reply and are not
something that is actionable by me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reply&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I receive a message that requires a short reply that will take me
less than a minute to write, I will compose the message and send it as
soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;To do&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For messages that require a longer reply or ones that require me to
complete a task, they are moved to my &lt;em&gt;To Do&lt;/em&gt; folder. This folder then
becomes my &lt;em&gt;To Do&lt;/em&gt; list. I have one location where I can go and take
care of all my tasks, without rummaging through my inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using DART, inbox 0 is achievable. Messages you need or want saved
are in &lt;em&gt;All Mail&lt;/em&gt; and messages that are actionable are in &lt;em&gt;To Do&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Addendum&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using GMail from an iOS device, the default action is to archive
any email that is deleted, so, in effect, it combines the &lt;em&gt;Delete&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;Archive&lt;/em&gt; feature into just &lt;em&gt;Archive&lt;/em&gt;. You can adjust this in your
settings, but I'd recommend using the GMail app for most of your email
needs (although you will still need your account added to your email
accounts in settings for sending emails from apps). A nice feature of
the GMail app is the &lt;em&gt;Unread&lt;/em&gt; view.&lt;/p&gt;

really isn't an easy way to select student email and take it out of your
inbox. It won't match on part of an address, so you can't just search
for an email address that starts with a number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've done is configure Google Apps for Education to append a footer
for all email from students with the tag:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;#studentofkcs&lt;/code&gt;. That also means that if you are now a Google Apps for
Education user or cannot automatically add this tag to the footer of
your student email messages you will have to have the students do it
themselves. Most email packages allow the user to add a signature to
their email messages, they just need to be sure to add a piece of text
that will be unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To filter email from students, go to GMail and in the search field at
the top of the screen enter #studentofkcs and hit the triangle to the
left of the blue button with the magnifying class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/filtering-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then click &lt;strong&gt;Create filter with this search&lt;/strong&gt;. It will have a list of
things that can happen to the message when it matches the search. You
will want to check &lt;strong&gt;Skip the inbox (Archive it)&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Apply the
label:&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/filtering-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you probably don't already have a label (or folder, if you want to
call it that) set up, you can click on the &lt;strong&gt;Choose label...&lt;/strong&gt; and
create a new label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/filtering-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to put an exclamation point in front of the label so when the
list of labels are sorted alphabetically, the ones I've created are at
the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/filtering-4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt; and then &lt;strong&gt;Create Filter&lt;/strong&gt;. From now on, email from
students will bypass your inbox and be in the your label created above.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Has Apple lost it?</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2012/09/12/has-apple-lost-it/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-12T18:38:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-09-12T18:38:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2012-09-12:/2012/09/12/has-apple-lost-it/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple announced the iPhone 5 today and updates to the iPod line.

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 5 is …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple announced the iPhone 5 today and updates to the iPod line. Most of
the announcements were lackluster at best, but the event laid the
groundwork for the rumored iPad mini event in October, which could be
even more disastrous than the iPhone 5 event today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 5 is a nice upgrade, thinner and lighter, but at the same
time, it doesn’t have any feature that makes it a must upgrade for me
and my iPhone 4. This is probably more of a testimonial on how good a
phone the 4 is than what the 5 brings to the table. There are features
in the next version of iOS that I won’t be able to use, such as
turn-by-turn navigation, and, I’m assuming, Facetime over cellular, but
since there are apps I can use to replace these missing features I’m not
that worried about upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more disturbing about todays event was the iPod line refresh.
Apple now sells the iPod shuffle, iPod nano, and iPod touch (the Classic
is still available, but it hasn’t seen an update in 3 years). The iPod
shuffle makes sense as an entry level music player, and at \$49, makes
it pretty affordable. After the shuffle comes the nano, which doesn’t
make sense at all. At least the 6th generation nano had a cool look and
could be used as a watch, this 7th generation looks like an iPod touch,
works like an iPod touch, but isn’t an iPod touch. Why would Apple waste
engineering sources on the nano? They priced it at \$149, only \$50 less
than the entry level iPod touch that includes the same amount of
storage. I just can’t think of a use case where the nano makes a better
purchase than the iPod touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the iPod touch. At the \$199 price point, they’re now
selling the 4th generation iPod touch with 16Gb instead of just 8GB. No
other changes in the now two year old device. If you want the new iPod
touch which has several of the goodies of the iPhone 5, be prepared to
shell out \$299. You do get 32Gb at this price but is it worth a third
more than the iPod touch 4th generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the pricing of the iPod touch which is the most worrisome. Making a
guess about the iPad mini launch next month, I bet that Apple will drop
the iPad 2 and put the iPad mini in at the \$399 price. This would hand
the Christmas shopping season to Amazon, Google, and possibly Barnes and
Noble. The software for iOS is heads and shoulders above what is
available for Android, but when a parent can pick up two Kindle Fire HDs
for the price of one iPad mini, what choice do you think they’re going
to make? I really doubt they’d price the iPad mini at the same price as
the new iPod touch, but let’s say they do. It would still be a third
higher than the Kindle Fire HD, although closer in price to the Nexus 7
32GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has solid devices, well built, but their pricing expectations are
all over the place. To me, it makes sense to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep the shuffle at \$49&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;place the old nano form factor (but with bluetooth) with 8GB at \$99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPod touch 4th gen (8GB) (add bluetooth 4.0 and IPS screen) at \$149&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPod touch 5th gen (16GB) at \$199&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPad mini (16GB) at \$299&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPad 2 (16GB) at \$399&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPad 3 (16GB) at \$499&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see more and more kids getting Kindle Fires, which is now at \$159.
Apple has dominated the tablet space (and the mobile phone space in
profits), but if they don’t price their products more aggressively, they
will lose that dominance. Right now, a \$299 iPad mini would be a tough
sell in my school district when I get get a Nexus 7 (which has better
integration with Google Drive) for \$199. Forget about a \$399 iPad
mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s. Signs that Steve Jobs is gone: he would never have added that hand
strap to the iPod touch.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="apple"></category><category term="iPad"></category><category term="iPhone"></category><category term="ipodtouch"></category></entry><entry><title>Impressions of the Nexus 7 Tablet</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2012/07/23/impressions-of-the-nexus-7-tablet/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-23T12:47:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-07-23T12:47:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2012-07-23:/2012/07/23/impressions-of-the-nexus-7-tablet/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those that know me, ordering a Google Nexus 7 Tablet when it was

released isn't much of a surprise. I did wait a day though. :-) The
Nexus 7 Tablet joins the stable of portable devices at home, which
include a couple of iPad 1s, and iPad 3, a couple of cheap Android
tablets imported from China, an iPhone, and an HP Tablet running both
WebOS and Android Ice Cream Sandwich. My first impressions will be
mainly what I see are the pros and cons of the Nexus 7. I'm not much of
a reviewer, you can find tons of other reviews around the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardware itself is very nice, although it doesn't have the wide
viewing angles of the iPad, it's not bad. My test for viewing angles is
to lay the device flat on a table and see how well I can see the screen.
On the iPad I can use it laying flat, the Nexus 7 is also usable, just
dim enough to make me want to pick it up. Text is very nice looking,
better than the iPad 1 or Touchpad. The high resolution screen in a 7
inch size isn't "retina" ready, but it doesn't need to be. The device
fits in the front pockets of my cargo shorts, although it is too tall to
button the top flap of the cargo pockets. It's summer, so I don't know
how it will fit in dress pants, I'll find that out at the end of August.
On one side of the device there are four gold pegs that are flush with
the edge. I'm assuming this means that a dock will be available to use
the tablet in landscape mode. Over bluetooth I was able to pair a
keyboard and mouse, which makes it quite nice to use on a desk or table.
This review is being typed in Evernote using the Logitech Ultrathin
Keyboard case from my iPad 3. It's pretty neat that the home key on the
keyboard still works. In fact, most of the keys work with it (volume,
lock, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First negative to the tablet is the wide screen aspect ratio. I've read
review bashing the iPad for it's 4:3 aspect ratio, but after using the
Nexus 7 it feels like this is a good design choice with tablets. The
16:9 ratio means that the screen isn't quite wide enough when in
portrait mode, but it's not tall enough to be used in landscape mode.
When using the Nexus 7 in landscape it feels like I'm back on my
original &lt;a href="http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/lynx/lynx.html" title="Atari Lynx"&gt;Atari Lynx&lt;/a&gt;. Or holding on to a 2x4 by the ends. Other than
that, there aren't any real negatives about the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software is another story. While Android has progressively gotten
better, it's still not up to the polished feel of iOS. There are little
things that bother me. For example, when I'm looking at my list of apps
in Google Play, I can tap on an app to get more info or to install the
app. But, when I hit the back key, I am placed back at the top of the
list, not where I was. Annoying. Also, I had to install a different
launcher since the default launcher (think home screen) doesn't work in
landscape mode. Android still doesn't have the quality of apps that iOS
does, such as TweetBot, Paper by Fifty Three, Garageband, and iMovie. I
do need to investigate multimedia creation apps. It does have a Google
Drive app that is very nice and supports editing of word processing
documents. And the Share icon available in most apps is very nice and a
lot more usable than it is in iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The onscreen keyboard still needs work. I've replaced it with SwiftKey,
which is a lot better than the default keyboard, but it's still not as
fast as typing on my iPhone or iPad. Selecting text is servicable,
although not enjoyable. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you buy it? Is this a device for schools? As of right now, I'm in
a wait and see mode. I know in the past I've said to base decisions on
what is available now, not what may be available, but with the rumor
that an 8" iPad may be announced in October, I feel patience is best.
All of the software negatives I've mentioned above can be rectified with
updates, but can they be by October? If you are a school district that
is not looking at iOS devices, the Nexus 7 tablet is a worthy contender,
especially if you are a Google Apps for Education school. This could be
the start of an one to one program that is sustainable in a lot of
districts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I forgot to mention two items, battery life and charging issues. First
off, battery life. It's ok, but it's no iPad. I've found that the Nexus
7 can barely make it through a day without needing charged. The reports
of 7 hour of battery life doesn't seem quite right. Using it for web,
email, IM, and a few other things (no media playback or games) has it
last maybe 6 hours. And that goes into my next rant about charging it.
This isn't a bullet point but a RANT! The Nexus 7 will only charge with
its USB cord and its charger. I've tried different chargers, including
an iPad charger, and it won't charge. It seems to show a charge when
plugged into my MacBook Air, but it doesn't charge. What is the point of
using a mini USB for the connector if I can't charge it?!?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="android"></category><category term="nexus7"></category></entry><entry><title>Something about iPads</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2012/04/17/something-about-ipads/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-04-17T18:44:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-04-17T18:44:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2012-04-17:/2012/04/17/something-about-ipads/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;text-align: right"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking a lot lately about iPads, Chromebooks, Android
Tablets, and Linux laptops. In planning the next 5 years of technology
in my school district, I know it will be mobile, but what device should
I be thinking about? And then I noticed something very curious about the
iPad and how people interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, when I've done professional development, there would always
be some participants that would question the complexity. “Why are there
so many steps?” “I’ll never remember all these!” Now with iPad training,
I very seldom hear these comments. In fact, with all the hoops one must
jump through on the iPad to do some tasks, people almost seem to enjoy
it. These are the same people that would be overwhelmed with the
complexity of doing the same task under desktop operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this the &lt;a href="http://www.mguhlin.org/2012/04/epiphany-of-experiences-ipads-in.html"&gt;epiphany&lt;/a&gt; that techies are missing? A device that defies
our expectations of technology? The iPad with its touch and non-window
interface turns the last 20 years of technology use on its head. For the
first time in 15 years, people are realizing that they can use a
&lt;a href="http://minimalmac.com/post/17758177061/microsofts-biggest-miss"&gt;computing platform that doesn’t have Microsoft Office on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reminded of a situation when I first bought the Nintendo Wii. At the
time, motion control was brand new, and I was playing my brother in a
first person shooter. He couldn’t quite get the hang of using the
controller, preferring wild swings instead of using the controller with
style and finesse. It was the first new gaming interface he had used
since the analog stick was added to the Nintendo 64 and he was
struggling. It seems we get too comfortable with what we know, instead
of pushing through to see what we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These same discussions are taking place with the new interface of
Windows 8. People are lamenting the loss of the desktop, even as
Microsoft assures them that the desktop will still be there when using
Windows 8 on a desktop or laptop computer. It’s funny in a way, I
remember these same arguments when the switch from Microsoft DOS to
Microsoft Windows was taking place. The writing is on the wall for the
desktop metaphor. People don’t want to manually manage their
&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/03/08/the-static-document-model-is-dying-rip-doc-xls-and-ppt/"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; anymore. Or the apps. And most importantly, their
computer. They want to use it to get stuff done, and they’ve found that
the iPad allows them to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As districts buy more and more iPads will the new paradigm of touch
computing with a tablet be the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had the new iPad for 24 hours, and it has already ruined me for all
other displays. I noticed it yesterday, as I was working on my 24"

&lt;p&gt;I've had the new iPad for 24 hours, and it has already ruined me for all
other displays. I noticed it yesterday, as I was working on my 24"
1920x1080 monitor at school. It just looks bad after using the new iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an upgrade to the iPad 1, the new iPad is a no brainer upgrade. The
speed is amazing, but it's the display that is the future. I don't even
want to use my 11" Air anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more in-depth reviews from around the web, so I'm going to
try to pull out the little bits that may not be covered but I feel are
important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The #1 feature is the display, 2058x1536 in a 9.7" package is just
    amazing. This is the highest resolution screen I've ever used, and
    text looks as good as e-ink on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed of the device is a substantial improvement over the iPad 1 or
    iPhone 4. I haven't used the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S enough to
    compare the two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPhone/iPod Touch apps at 2x use retina resolutions for the devices,
    giving the apps a more pleasant display. If you are running an iPad
    that is already jailbroke, there are apps to allow you to do this
    with the older devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm using my ZAGG/mate bluetooth keyboard from my iPad 1 on it. The
    new iPad is very loose in the keyboard case, but it's useable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're still rocking an iPad 1, it's pretty much a no brainer to
upgrade. The decision from an iPad 2 is better left for others to help
you decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, the Apple Store online has refurbished iPad 1s for \$299
right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is a service that works almost identically to Dropbox. Their
differentiating feature is the fact that they use your Google Docs
account for storage. A downside to this is that you only have 1GB of
storage with normal accounts, but Google lets you add 20GB to that for
\$5 a year (compared to Dropbox costing \$10 a month for 50GB of space).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set up, you download the client, install it, and log into your Google
account or accounts. It lets you sync multiple Google accounts at the
same time, so I can use it with my work Google account, my professional
Google account, and my personal Google account. Insync creates a folder
in your home directory called Insync, and creates a folder for each one
of your accounts inside of it. Google Docs files show up as their
Microsoft Office equivilents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works really well, just as well as Dropbox. There are a few
annoyances, such as the inability to pause syncing (for example, if
you?re on slow connection), but for the price it?s hard for Dropbox to
beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tip I would recommend is to create a folder inside your Google
account folder and use that like you would use a Dropbox account. If
your Google Docs account is anything like mine, you have a ton of files
and very little organization. Since I?m using this basically as a
Dropbox replacement, I created a folder called DesktopSync, and I use
that like I would use my Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in a Google Apps for Education school district, your Google
accounts work fine with Insync. I haven?t tested it on our client
computers that students use yet. If it works there, it would be a very
nice solution to file access outside of the district.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="dropbox"></category><category term="Google"></category><category term="insync"></category></entry><entry><title>Beware of the echo chamber</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2011/11/30/beware-of-the-echo-chamber/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-11-30T13:33:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-11-30T13:33:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2011-11-30:/2011/11/30/beware-of-the-echo-chamber/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As my school district was preparing for a building levy back in November

(which did pass, yeah!!), I talked to community members what they felt
the chances for a new building were. Most of them were enthusiastic,
saying that they were hearing a lot of positive talk on Facebook. But
when I pointed out that their friends on Facebook were more likely to be
supportive since they were about the same age and had around the same
aged kids, the enthusiasm waned. As we connect virtually with more an
more people, are we enhancing this echo chamber, where like minded
individuals pat each other on the back and agree with everything is
said?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to follow people that may not agree with me or my ideas. While it
is important to have supporters, it is just as important to have someone
that pushes the boundaries. The trick is to be able to carry on a
constructive dialog without coming across preachy or to take things
personally. I’ve had &lt;strong&gt;heated&lt;/strong&gt; discussions with others that instead of
debating the conflict, they let emotion take over. When a conversation
becomes a personal attack, it is then time to take a step back and
revisit the discussion at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compromise seems to be a lost art in the present. The congressional
&lt;strong&gt;Super Committee&lt;/strong&gt; failure to come to a decision exemplifies this. We
cannot afford to not discuss rationally, accepting compromises when
needed, in the education of our students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversity is the spice of life. Your personal learning network should
contain individuals that have all different viewpoints. You’ll learn
just as much from them as from those you agree with.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="oped socialnetworking"></category></entry><entry><title>The Wingstand: a stand for your iPhone or iPad and the Apple Bluetooth Keyboard</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2011/11/16/the-wingstand-a-stand-for-your-iphone-or-ipad-and-the-apple-bluetooth-keyboard/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-11-16T20:38:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-11-16T20:38:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2011-11-16:/2011/11/16/the-wingstand-a-stand-for-your-iphone-or-ipad-and-the-apple-bluetooth-keyboard/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the first accessories I purchased with the original iPad was the

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I've been using it with my iPhone when I'm out and don't have
access to wifi. It works ok, but I was getting tired of constantly
moving the iPhone, trying to get it in a good place to use it with the
keyboard. I started looking online for solutions, since there were a ton
of iPad cases with BT keyboards, I was hoping there would be something
for the iPhone. It was then I stumbled across the &lt;a href="http://wingstand.com"&gt;Wingstand&lt;/a&gt;.
Consisting of two pieces of plastic, it can be used with or without the
BT keyboard to prop up your phone or tablet. It's not Apple specific. At
\$14.95 shipped it seems a little pricey for a couple pieces of plastic,
but it is made here in the USA and it does work really well. I'm typing
this post with my BT keyboard and using the iPhone (unfortunately I have
to use the iPhone in the portrait orientation since the Wordpress app
doesn't appear to switch to landscape). My original iPad fits with the
Apple case on, and so does my HP Touchpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to use an external keyboard with your iPhone or iPad,
this might be an inexpensive way to work. Let me know if there are any
other solutions I've missed in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

- Also go to the other buildings&lt;br&gt;
- They get a MacBook&lt;br&gt;
- Digital camera this year&lt;br&gt;
- Taught to be responsible with social media&lt;br&gt;
- Real life experience. Work in the administration offices during class
period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student videos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is the 4 Cs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did we need the senior experience?&lt;br&gt;
- additional help&lt;br&gt;
- Social media experience&lt;br&gt;
- Main Street Madison - parent lead public forum. People were visiting
it for information instead of going to the school's website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan:&lt;br&gt;
- First year the students were hand picked for the pilot.&lt;br&gt;
- Wanted it to be part of the main website&lt;br&gt;
- want video and pictures in the blog&lt;br&gt;
- promoting the seniors&lt;br&gt;
- highlight videos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it evaluated&lt;br&gt;
- Students are earning language arts credit&lt;br&gt;
- students still have to take senior English&lt;br&gt;
- problem based learning&lt;br&gt;
- website hits&lt;br&gt;
- a lot less misconceptions posted on main street Madison&lt;br&gt;
- track top pages on site, blogs are consistently in the top 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People do want to hear about the academics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks&lt;br&gt;
- safety: signed aup, contract, loan agreement for equipment,&lt;br&gt;
- Money: permanent improvement funds,&lt;br&gt;
- Responsibility: AJ Huff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Don't be afraid to take risks, especially smart ones. " - Steve Jobs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: did you have to turn people away the 2nd year?&lt;br&gt;
A: received a list of 40 recommendations from the English dept.
Widdowed it down to 20, then discussed with the principal. 12 were asked
to apply, of which 10 did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: comments are blocked on the blogs, what about the FB page?&lt;br&gt;
A: FB page is new, but hopefully can turn negative comments to
positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Any plans to open it to others?&lt;br&gt;
A: not at this time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How did you come up with 6?&lt;br&gt;
A: Original plan was they would be paired, because they work
unsupervised in the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How will you use Facebook?&lt;br&gt;
A: Ultimate goal is to still drive traffic back to the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How often do the students post?&lt;br&gt;
A: In the beginning they tried 1 to 2 times a week, but that became an
issue with all the other projects. Now it's around once every 7-10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How do you handle their personal FB pages?&lt;br&gt;
A: That's really outside of the jurisdiction of the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How much do you change their articles?&lt;br&gt;
A: Quick edits, try not to change the message. Did have a problem with
one post, student talked about the whole family going to Florida for
spring break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Controversal issues in the school?&lt;br&gt;
A: Situation hasn't come up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the project the student get to keep the machine when they
graduate from school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The netbooks weren't powerful enough, so now they've moved to more
robust laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the idea was born&lt;br&gt;
- Textbook costs and weight in book bags&lt;br&gt;
- Utilize 21st century learning skills and tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need for change&lt;br&gt;
- Only 28% of Ohio students (2011) who took the ACT met all four
college readiness benchmarks&lt;br&gt;
- 1968 Divergent Thinking Study by George Land - Created tests to
identify geniuses.&lt;br&gt;
? example question: How many uses of a a paperclip? 10 is normal, 200
is genius&lt;br&gt;
?? 3-5 year olds, 98% genius&lt;br&gt;
?? 8-10 year olds 30%&lt;br&gt;
?? 13-15 year olds 12%&lt;br&gt;
?? Adults (31 year average) 2%&lt;br&gt;
?? (The same group of students)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finite curriculum that we assess with a series of multiple choice
questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to focus on how we are teaching students, we currently focus too
much on the what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators spend too much of their class time transferring knowledge.
Then assign homework to be completed when the teacher isn't around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're using the iPad in the same way you used the textbook, you
haven't fundamentally changed the delivery of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flip the classroom&lt;br&gt;
- Transfer knowledge is the homework&lt;br&gt;
- Class time is spent answering/clarifying the knowledge that was
learned for homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example old lesson:&lt;br&gt;
Round robin reading of the material, teacher adds their commentary
through a powerpoint, then homework is assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flipping the classroom&lt;br&gt;
Transfer happens on student's time, classwork consists of working
through questions about the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barriers to flipping the classroom&lt;br&gt;
- Availability and reliability of technology&lt;br&gt;
- Teacher resistance to change&lt;br&gt;
- The learning to read, reading to learn curve. Starting in grades &gt;4
it's easier to work, students can read for instruction.&lt;br&gt;
- Educating parents about this chift in teaching&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages of flipping&lt;br&gt;
- More time is spent on applied learning&lt;br&gt;
- 3Cs communication, collaboration, creative thinking&lt;br&gt;
- Student centered classroom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the presentation was flipped&lt;br&gt;
- Participants would have been required to watch the presentation
before hand&lt;br&gt;
- Broken up into groups, watch videos of teachers in the classroom,
discuss&lt;br&gt;
- Present findings to the group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation&lt;br&gt;
- What's the home situation like? How many siblings share a computer?&lt;br&gt;
- Ownership of the laptops, students take care of the equipment.&lt;br&gt;
- Started with 8th graders&lt;br&gt;
-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Internet access for free/reduced?&lt;br&gt;
A: Not provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Buying textbooks?&lt;br&gt;
A: Up to the textbook companies. Should they even buy textbooks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How do teachers with multiple preps do it?&lt;br&gt;
A: Building it out slowly. Once it's done, it's done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do good ideas come from?&lt;br&gt;
- Does chance favor the connected mind?&lt;br&gt;
- Steven Johnson video&lt;br&gt;
? Recurring patterns to innovations&lt;br&gt;
?? Slow hunch&lt;br&gt;
??? Good ideas come from the collisions of other ideas that are
stewing&lt;br&gt;
??? Tim Berners-Lee, WWW. Took ten years&lt;br&gt;
??? Sometimes it takes a hunch from someone else to combine with
another hunch for the eureka moment.&lt;br&gt;
? Great driver in innovations is connectivity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important to provide&lt;br&gt;
- Quality tech&lt;br&gt;
- Adequate bandwidth&lt;br&gt;
- Adequate tech support&lt;br&gt;
? 7:15am on Tuesday, 3:15pm on Thursdays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Daggett Rigor/Relevance Framework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filtering&lt;br&gt;
- We filter, exercise in futility&lt;br&gt;
- By law, not necessary at home&lt;br&gt;
- Ultrasurf: Created by the government for Egyptians to surf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move to year round usage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8th grade student&lt;br&gt;
- Watching the lecture gives him the freedom to pause/rewatch and
repeat.&lt;br&gt;
- Can just ask a question if totally lost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science teacher&lt;br&gt;
- Gives students the ability to take responsibility of their own
learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some students don't like the flipped classroom, they're used to the
currecnt way instruction is given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How do you do teacher training&lt;br&gt;
A: Training during the week. Additional training for the teachers with
classrooms that have netbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What do you say to someone who's afraid of failure on the state test
due to the change in structure?&lt;br&gt;
A: They've never had a student come back and say they didn't do as well
on a state test, they come back and tell how much better they are at
communicating. Supt: I want to know how the students are learning, and
believes that they do well on the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How much time is spent on homework?&lt;br&gt;
A: More time right now, as they learn, and not all teachers are doing
it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How are you planning on staying up with technology? Software
upgrades?&lt;br&gt;
A: Cloud computing has helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers aren't excited about how easy it is to be fact checked. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How long is a video?&lt;br&gt;
A: Ten minutes average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How is video delivered?&lt;br&gt;
A: Google Apps with Google Sites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: When they leave what happens to licenced materials?&lt;br&gt;
A: District takes it off when the student leaves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE TERM IS CALLED FUD IN TECHNOLOGY CIRCLES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If school leadership is the problem, then everyone else doesn't have to
change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NO BLUEBERRY STORY TODAY. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall street journal: abolish local school boards.&lt;br&gt;
The farther the decision maker is from the child, the dumber the
decision gets. Core principle one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People used to rally against the soviet central planning. Concentrate
all power in the hands of a small group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrible trends:&lt;br&gt;
Demographics-percentage of taxpayers with children in school in Ohio is
less than 20%. A lot of people have the been there,done that attitude.
They have forgotten something. Public education has two reasons for ring
developed. Individual benefit for students, the public good. Everybody
benefits when they support the public schools. Every aspect of their
quality of life is tied toward their local schools. Higher student
achievement, lower crime rates. After 7-10 years, tax base rises. Teen
pregnancy falls. ER use as primary care facility falls. Vote no leads to
the degradation of their community&lt;br&gt;
Media is a "tad" negative. :-) negativity sells because we like it.
Schadenfreude.&lt;br&gt;
At the community's turf, at the communities convenience.&lt;br&gt;
The great clanning of America. School is there to melt us. What if no
one ones to be melted anymore? "I don't want my kids with 'them'".
Races, socioeconomic, political.&lt;br&gt;
Tinker vs. school board, Vietnam armband protest. Past rights: "I had
the right to sit down and shut up."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents are used to getting an advanced customizations. Every student
getting an IEP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engage your community, positive for schools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the best of times. For the first time we have to teach all
children to high levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education greats weren't the a ha moment, writings by the father of
public education, Thomas Jefferson. "Rake the genius from the rubbish."
we didn't need a lot of people to think for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1965-77% of the workforce was low level skills. Making enough money for
the American dream. Currently 13%. In 5 years, 5%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need thinkers, we can't afford not too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools and their staff have the power to change moral sentiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formal track of the great conversation, from the BOE. Go to where the
community is for meetings. There are millions that hated schools. They
hate going there. Go to them. In teams. Staff should front load the
conversation. Americans trust teachers more than BOE of administrators.
America trusts the classifies employees even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community understanding. The community doesn't understand what you do.
Jamie's magic list. Things added in the last century.&lt;br&gt;
Not added a single minute to the school calendar in 7 decades. Download
at Jamie Vollmer.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The golden age of education never existed. Must break the mental model
of what school is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community must trust the schools. As understanding grows, so does trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community permission to do it differently. Need to stop grouping
students. Y date of manufacture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community support. Can't go from A to B without going through C, the
community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Ss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop bad mouthing others in publics. Gripe to your spouse, that's
    why we have them. :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift your negatives to the positives. The more negative you become
    the more you compromise your immune system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share. Share something positive about what's going on in your
    school. Something positive happens every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustain the effort, keep this up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start. Start this now. Whoever molds the public sentiment wins the
    day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joined: moral and practical thing to do. We need thinkers. Poorly
educated people are desperate, and desperate people are dangerous.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mississinawa Valley Local school district&lt;br&gt;
- Pilot school for eDays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replace snow days with eDays?&lt;br&gt;
- ancedotes: take away sled time? :-) Big learning experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background/History&lt;br&gt;
- Supt. brought in through a video&lt;br&gt;
- Learning can continue when the instructor can't be in front of the
students&lt;br&gt;
- District covers 80 square miles, miss days after snowfall due to
wind&lt;br&gt;
- Superintendent Wendel formalizes plan that is used as a basis for the
house bill&lt;br&gt;
- House bill dies, could be due to lobbying from the AFT&lt;br&gt;
- Applied for waiver days from the ODE to try it out.&lt;br&gt;
- Big response from across the nation, spent a lot of time in
interviews&lt;br&gt;
- Governor Kasich re-institutes the 5 calamity days and adds 3 online
days to the budget bill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School plan&lt;br&gt;
- Teachers are already required to come in two days in the summer. One
was used for eDay PD&lt;br&gt;
- The other day was used to complete lessons&lt;br&gt;
- Teachers were paid for two days, but more was put in on their own
time.&lt;br&gt;
- Prepare students and parents. Teachers took class time to show the
students, parent meetings in the evening in an open computer lab&lt;br&gt;
- Variety of lessons, and a student product (an assignment and
assessment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eLesson Components&lt;br&gt;
- Target&lt;br&gt;
Pick some standards that are hard to hit in the classroom due to other
standards&lt;br&gt;
- Instruction&lt;br&gt;
Reading&lt;br&gt;
Podcasts&lt;br&gt;
Vodcasts&lt;br&gt;
- Teacher contact information&lt;br&gt;
--Duplicate the learning that occurs in a normal day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson types&lt;br&gt;
- Rubric was used to grade the lesson: Basic, Intermediate, and
Advanced&lt;br&gt;
- Everyone was required to have a Basic lesson, but the goal was for
the teachers to move to intermediate and/or advanced lesson plans&lt;br&gt;
- Component of an eDay Lesson: Student Tasks, Student Product&lt;br&gt;
- See Darke County ESC for rubric&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens on an eDay&lt;br&gt;
- Teachers/students notified&lt;br&gt;
- Teaches enable lessons, using First Class&lt;br&gt;
- Teachers will be available for consilt during day either by phone or
email&lt;br&gt;
- Students have 2 weeks to complete assignments if needed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if students don't have internet?&lt;br&gt;
- Initial survey showed that only 11% did not have Internet, 50%
free/reduced lunches&lt;br&gt;
- Discuss with students ahead of time&lt;br&gt;
- Weather permitting:&lt;br&gt;
? Community building open with laptops and tech coordinator&lt;br&gt;
? School building will be open&lt;br&gt;
- 2 week window to complete assignments&lt;br&gt;
? Work on them during non-instructional times of school day&lt;br&gt;
? After school hours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sample Pages&lt;br&gt;
- First class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHERE IS MOODLE? GOOGLE DOCS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teacher is usually online to assist during the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only open up the current eDay's lesson, didn't want students to
    complete all the eday work on the first day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHY NOT? IF THEY CAN COMPLETE IT SUCCESSFULLY, WHY NOT LET THEM COMPLETE
IT ALL?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issues that cropped up: lessons took too much time, computer sharing
    in households with multiple students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teachers learned a lot of what works and what doesn't work the first
    year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Found out some students only had dial-up, video was difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICE USE OF A DIGITAL CAMERA TO "SCAN" IN PAGES TO PUT ON A WEBPAGE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lessons are stand alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I HOPE THEY AREN'T TEACHING SKILLS IN ISOLATION, THEY SHOULD BUILD
SOMEWHAT ON THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR (MAKE UP DAYS WOULDN'T BE UNTIL
ALL CALAMATY DAYS ARE EXHAUSTED, WHICH WOULDN'T BE UNTIL JAN OR FEB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surfing the Internet took a lot a time because there is so much
    stuff out there. Actually inspired the teacher to integrate other
    resources that were found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elementary PE: Timed sit-ups, push-ups, and measure reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NO SHOVELING SNOW? :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teacher's daughter wanted to do some of the activities after the
    eDay ended&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistic Comparisons&lt;br&gt;
- 100% of the teachers believed their eLessons were of high
instructional value&lt;br&gt;
- 72% of the students said they were able to learn by completing the
eLessons&lt;br&gt;
- 80% of the parents thought the lessons were of high instructional
value&lt;br&gt;
- 52% of the students said the learning equaled what they learn on a
"regular" day, 60% of parents&lt;br&gt;
- 100% of teachers, 57% of students, 67% of parents believed the school
should continue the eDay program&lt;br&gt;
- Older siblings liked helping the younger students complete some of
their tasks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;br&gt;
- Too much time between the actual eDay and when they are due. More
information and tasks were given than what would have been given in a
normal class period&lt;br&gt;
- Students were frustrated in the completion of the lesson and the time
it took&lt;br&gt;
- Students are passive learners&lt;br&gt;
- There should be no athletic practices during school time on eDays&lt;br&gt;
- Parents view parental involvment as something that occurs inside the
school&lt;br&gt;
- Incorporate this type of technology throughout the year&lt;br&gt;
- Online time cannot equal chair time&lt;br&gt;
- Automated system for product return is necassary&lt;br&gt;
- Need a consistent, agreed upon method for student/teacher
communication&lt;br&gt;
- Lack of completion consequences needs to be more fully developed&lt;br&gt;
- More parent/student prep needed&lt;br&gt;
- Need to have a contingency plan before you need the contengency plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COULD AN EDAY BE USED TO ALLOW TEACHERS PD DAYS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONTIGENCY PLAN FOR SERVER ISSUES?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q/A&lt;br&gt;
Q:How do you deal with students special needs?&lt;br&gt;
A: Modified classroom teacher lessons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How did you structure your pilot?&lt;br&gt;
A: 100% of the teachers involved, followed the steps listed above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: If two weeks are too long, are you going to change? Do teachers
prepare lessons for each subject in self-contained classrooms?&lt;br&gt;
A: Havent approached the two week window. Teachers create lessons for
each subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Moodle?&lt;br&gt;
A: Looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Costs?&lt;br&gt;
A: Practically nothing, since First Class was already in place. Already
had days in place for PD. Probably 4 or 5 hours for each lesson.
Research takes time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Union buy in?&lt;br&gt;
A: Union and administration identified the need and mutually agreed to
it. No one wanted to be there mid-June. Waiver days gave them two
additional days at Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: No computer?&lt;br&gt;
A: Places open for computer use, and two weeks to have things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Outside of snow days, such as no electricity due to winds/ice.&lt;br&gt;
A: Discuss as a district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Is there a real problem with students working ahead?&lt;br&gt;
A: It depends on the teachers and how the lesson was designed. What's
in their lessons, how it's set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How did you report this to the state department?&lt;br&gt;
A: The survey data was reported to the state, along with the waivers
for the eDays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comment: Mt. Vernon had a day without electricity, so they just used the
two weeks to get the work completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a pretty high tech article, but the benefits
outweigh the work that it requires. I'm going to talk about using
&lt;a href="http://cloudflare.com"&gt;cloudflare.com&lt;/a&gt; to cache your website and offer IPv6 compatibility.
For this to work you have to be using your own domain name and have
access to change the namerservers for your domain. If you cannot do
this, then you can't take advantage of &lt;a href="http://cloudflare.com"&gt;cloudflare.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To speed up access to a website, the larger sites around the Internet
cache data as close as possible to the end user, usually using some sort
of content delivery network (CDN). For the enduser, that speeds up
access to the website, since instead of a US user having to transfer
data from a UK website, the US user would only need to pull it from a
closer server. There are also other tricks that CDNs use to lower
bandwidth usage and increase speed. Cloudflare acts like a CDN on your
behalf, automatically caching your website around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IPv6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPv6 is the next version of the Internet addressing protocol, set to
replace the current IPv4. If you have an IPv4 address you can't talk to
a user with an IPv6 address and vice versa. Most clients now support
both at once, but until all the connections between you and a website
upgrade their equipment and software to IPv6, you are still going to be
using IPv4 addressing for awhile. This isn't true in Asia, where they've
exhausted their IPv4 addresses and there are users there that are only
getting an IPv6 address. If you only have an IPv6 address, then you only
have access to about 10,000 websites that are set up for IPv6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter Cloudflare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once configured, Cloudflare manages connections to your website, caching
the content. And with a simple switch on their website, you can turn on
IPv6 access to your website. &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org"&gt;ryancollins.org&lt;/a&gt; is now on Cloudflare's
network and should be accessible over IPv6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should you sign up?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to run it for awhile and see if any issues crop up. I just
noticed the "Threat Alerts" on my dashboard, where Cloudflare already
has blocked a couple of botnets from accessing the site. I've played
around with different caching plugins for Wordpress, but Cloudflare
seems like a lot better solution, especially since it doesn't require
any work. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="caching"></category><category term="cloudflare"></category><category term="wordpress"></category></entry><entry><title>Look out, there's a new tablet in town and it's HOT!</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2011/09/28/look-out-theres-a-new-tablet-in-town-and-its-hot/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-09-28T16:17:00-04:00</published><updated>2011-09-28T16:17:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2011-09-28:/2011/09/28/look-out-theres-a-new-tablet-in-town-and-its-hot/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Announcing the Kindle Fire&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon announced a few new Kindles today, the most important, in my
mind, is the Kindle Fire. It is a 7" tablet running a specialized
version of Android. The shocker was the price, \$199. With todays
announcement, every school district that is looking at mobile devices
will need to take a pause and examine what the Fire has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that price point, it undercuts the iPod Touch by \$30. It also
sacrifices a camera and microphone. But it makes up for those
deficiencies by offering a larger and better display. The main problem
with the Fire would be the lack of applications for the educational
market. Of course you have access to all the Kindle books, and the
explicitly list full color children's books for it, so it may be just a
matter of time before educational software takes off on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Does size matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our iOS pilot programs with iPod Touches and iPads it has become
pretty clear that it is hard to convince teachers that the small screen
of the iPod Touch can still be used for content creation. The students,
I've noticed, don't mind using the iPod Touch, so for them, size doesn't
matter. When it comes to content such as PDFs and books, the larger
screen size would be very advantageous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theft is also an issue in school, but the larger size of the Fire may be
a deterrent. The Fire would also be able to be used by more than one
student at a time due to it's size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Waiting..&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try to hold off any further mobile purchases until the Fire
is released and I get a chance to use one. I could see it replacing a
lot of iPod Touches this Christmas, it will be interesting to see what
Apple has in store on October 4th. If the applications come, the Fire
will be a very compelling device for school districts.&lt;/p&gt;

Apple II was Broderbund's &lt;strong&gt;The PrintShop&lt;/strong&gt;, right after that pirated
copy of AppleWorks. For the first time, users could create posters,

page layout tools became more and more commonplace, the final product to
be shared was an 8 1/2" x 11" (or A4 :-)) sized sheet of paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The world is going mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs are all around us that the personal computer as we know it is
dying, to replaced with mobile technologies. Whenever I do PD,
especially with iOS devices or other portable devices, I tell the
participants that in 5 years everyone will be using portable devices
instead of computers. Unfortunately, this doesn't go over very well. The
most common concern is how will they word process. After thinking about
it, I realized what was wrong with this question. In the future you will
not be creating content that the final product will be the printed page.
You, or your students, will be creating content that will be consumed on
other mobile devices. The concept of the printed page is dying.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="mobile"></category></entry><entry><title>I've been hacked and you can learn from my mistakes. :-)</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2011/08/28/ive-been-hacked-and-you-can-learn-from-my-mistakes/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-08-28T16:52:00-04:00</published><updated>2011-08-28T16:52:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2011-08-28:/2011/08/28/ive-been-hacked-and-you-can-learn-from-my-mistakes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hacked!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I let my Wordpress installation rot. And it's entirely my fault.
Wordpress makes it so easy to keep it up to date now that there is no
excuse, so I do accept full responsibility! I'm lucky in the fact that
all the hacker&lt;br&gt;
did was rewrite my .htaccess file to redirect visitors to a malware
hosted site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After examining the Wordpress database, it appeared that it hadn't been
changed by the attacker, so I went about installing a new copy of
Wordpress. It went pretty smooth, and for right now I'm going for a
minimum amount of&lt;br&gt;
plugins and keeping the design pretty basic. As I was restoring, I
began to think of what the hacker might of had access to and what I
needed to do to protect myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if the attacker had access to the filesystem or could
    only append lines onto the .htaccess file. Why is this important?
    Your MySQL password for your Wordpress installation is listed in the
    wp-config.php file. If you allow access to your MySQL server from
    the outside world, an attacker armed with this username and password
    is free to make changes to your database, even making themselves an
    administrator. So before doing the installation, I changed my
    password to MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One plugin I use with Wordpress is &lt;a href="http://www.webdesigncompany.net/automatic-wordpress-backup/"&gt;Automatic Wordpress Backup&lt;/a&gt;.
    This makes daily backups of my Wordpress installation and stores
    them on Amazon S3. What I realized after this hack was that if the
    attacker had gotten access to administrator privileges, he could
    have wiped out every single backup I have. Worse yet, they could
    gain access to my access keys for Amazon S3. I went in and changed
    my Amazon S3 access keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I'm doing differently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be keeping up on Wordpress updates!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wp-config.php file, which contains some very important
    information on your Wordpress installation does not need to live in
    a web accessible directory such as your main Wordpress installation.
    I moved it up a directory. For example, if you installed Wordpress
    in \~/public-html/, you can put wp-config.php in \~/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once my installation was completed, I created a user for myself and
    made it an administrator. I then logged in as my new administrator
    account and deleted the default administrator. This protects against
    hacks that target the default admin account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched to Disqus for comments. The blog only had one user, and I
    didn't want to worry about being hacked giving up reader
    information. By using Disqus, I let them handle it. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed the CHAP Secure Login plugin for Wordpress. This
    protects logins by encrypting the password. Since I don't have an
    SSL certificate, my password would be "in the clear" without this
    plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be automating the download of my backups from Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week as I was working on a presentation, I had a slide where I
asked the participants to discuss among themselves. I wanted to set a
time limit, but I didn't want to have to switch out of Keynote, I wanted
it on the slide. It took me a couple of minutes, but I finally came up
with a quite clever solution, if I do say so myself. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I needed was a little countdown video that would count
down from 10. I started a new Keynote project, and created a ten second
countdown. Originally I used ten slides, with the transition taking a
second, so that when played it would count down in ten seconds. The
problem came when I wanted to export the movie. The minimum amount of
time I could show a slide was two seconds, and since I didn't want to
count down by two a new solution had to be made. So I deleted all the
slides in my presentation save one, and put 11 text boxes on it (10-0).
I then did a pop build in and out, and set the time for the build to be
one second. The out build would happen concurrently with the in build of
the next number, so I got a pretty cool effect as a bonus. I &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Countdown.mov"&gt;exported
this out as a Quicktime movie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in my presentation, I added a question text box with a build in
transition to occur after a click. Next, I added my movie with a build
in transition to appear. The secret is to set the movie to appear
however many seconds you want to wait. I set it at 60 seconds, so
participants actually had 70 seconds until it finished. It doesn't
appear until the 60 second mark has passed, and then counts down to 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Works better than I had hoped! You can &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Countdown.mov"&gt;download the movie
here&lt;/a&gt;. (right click and use Save
as...)&lt;/p&gt;

students and teachers, while trying not to stray to the "dark side" of
technology. The twitter hastag will be #rcpartvi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second presentation is Tuesday, "An iPad, Kindle, and iPod Touch
walked into a classroom..." at 3:45 - 4:30 pm in room: C213 - 215. This
session will explore the Kindle, the iPad, and the iPod and how they can
be used in the classroom. Alternative technologies will also be
presented and discussed. The Twitter hashtag will be #rcmobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both presentations I'll be using Google Docs, and will update this
site with urls to the presentations. I'm going to try to use the "View
together" feature, where participants can follow along and actually
converse if they have Google accounts. For audio, I've set up a
Shoutcast server and I'll be attempting to broadcast the audio live
while presenting. I don't know how well it's going to work, but it
should be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was using Evernote for writing, but it doesn't have a full screen
mode. To emulate the ability to sync my notes written in JDarkroom with
my other devices I use &lt;a href="http://db.tt/wYZUa8E"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; (Affiliate code in link,
&lt;a href="http://dropbox.com"&gt;dropbox.com&lt;/a&gt; is the website without the affiliate code). Now I just
save my notes into my Dropbox, and Dropbox takes care of syncing them
across my devices. The Dropbox app for Android allows me to edit text
files directly in the application, and there are several apps for iOS
devices that will let you do the same. For mark up in text files I use
John Gruber's &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. It's a very readable way to encode
formatting in a text file. There are several libraries that let you then
convert it to html or back to markdown. I installed the &lt;a href="http://c.hadcoleman.com/wordpress-plugins/wmd-editor-wordpress-plugin/"&gt;WMD plug in for
Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; which allows me to write in Markdown (or just copy and
paste from one of my files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's a little convoluted, and as soon as Evernote as a full screen
editor option I'll probably switch back to it, it does work for me. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

Touch walked into a classroom...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I decided that it would be
beneficial to plan on questions about Android, Android Tablets, and how
they may work in schools. The Consumer Electronics Show was held this
past week, and during it a bevy of manufacturers announced tablets, with
almost all of them running Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android is an open source operating system created at Google based on
Linux. Google allows distributes this OS free of charge to be used by
manufacturers and cellular providers on mobile devices. It competes
against other mobile operating systems such as Apple's iOS (used on the
iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch), Microsoft Windows Phone 7, RIM Blackberry
OS, and HP's WebOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased a Motorola Droid off of eBay and received it this past week.
I've been playing around with it for the last couple of days, so this
isn't so much as a review as it is my first impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My smartphone history&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little history about my past and smartphones. I bought my first
smartphone, a Motorola Q around 2007 (I think. :-)). While it was my
first taste of online connectivity whereever I was, it was also my first
taste of, as the French would say, le pew. It was slow, ate batteries
like it was going out of style, ugly, and would just restart for now
reason. I moved on to a Samsung Omnia, then an HTC Ozone. The Ozone, at
the time (mid 2009) was Verizon's most unlocked phone. It had wifi and
the GPS was useable. All in all, not a bad phone, but still running
Windows Mobile. In August I purchased a Palm Pre Plus, which was heaven
compared to the Ozone. What holds it back is not the OS (which feels
like it could be an Apple product) but the hardware and lack of apps. As
an aside, AT&amp;amp;T does not offer service in my area, so I've gotten by with
an iPod Touch (first gen represent!) I bought in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This "First Look" will try to focus on the software itself, since in the
Android universe the quality and quantity of devices would overshadow
any comments about the hardware of the Motorola Droid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Rundown&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things I like:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The back button: Until I used WebOS I hadn't really thought about
    how useful a back gesture (or button) could be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Widgets: It's nice to be able to put my calendar on a screen, or a
    battery life indicator with other information about the hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of applications: So far I've been able to find an
    application for everything I need. In the market place there are
    also tons of clones of iOS games, but for the most part these are
    inferior to their iOS counterpart. Rope Cut is not Cut the Rope for
    iOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things I don't like:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notifcation bar: To open notifications you have to click and hold on
    the top bar and then drag down. Why I can't just click on the top
    bar for notifications I don't know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application switching: Unless I'm missing something, the only way to
    switch apps is to either exit back to home and click on the item or
    hold down the home key until the recently used applications show up.
    And heaven forbid you want to return to an open browser window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigation in applications: This is not consistant. Some apps, like
    imo.im (the instant messaging app I use) gives me a different menu
    depending on what screen I'm on, and to navigate to a certain screen
    may require several key presses and swipes through several other
    screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Uses in Education&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until models are released that don't require a cellular plan,
educational uses of Android are going to be limited. This year is going
to be interesting, but if you are currently researching which OS to use
in your classroom it would be hard to recommend Android until other
models are released. Android will have two big advantages over iOS
(which is going to be its biggest competitor in the upcoming year):
price and openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools rarely look at the total operating costs of equipment and
instead focus on purchase price. The Android tablets and handhelds will
be cheaper than their iOS cousins, and in some form factors will not
have competition (the 7 inch form factor such as the Nook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Openness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Android is Open Source, companies can release software to
automatically manage a fleet of devices. If you've been involved with
iOS app purchases, it requires several hoops to jump through, and then
it can't even automatically install the apps. This can change with
Android. Unfortunately, this will probably mean that any price savings
you received on the purchase of the devices will be eaten in the
management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Is it a contender?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Android is a contender in the mobile space. I believe that it is a
credible threat to the iPad/iPod Touch dominance we see in schools
today. Should you wait? No. If you are looking at implementing a mobile
device initiative then don't wait for Android devices. From an
educational point of view there isn't anything that can be done on one
that can't be done on the other. The Android app store seems to be
thriving, and as more devices are sold it will only entice more
developers. Mobile devices are set to overtake personal computers &lt;a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/08/11/the-great-game-mobile-devices-overtaking-pcs/"&gt;any
day now&lt;/a&gt; :-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What device do you use a majority of the time?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="android"></category><category term="cellphones"></category><category term="ios"></category><category term="mobile"></category></entry><entry><title>FIrst impressions of the MacBook Air 11"</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2010/10/27/first-impressions-of-the-macbook-air-11/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-10-27T11:23:00-04:00</published><updated>2010-10-27T11:23:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2010-10-27:/2010/10/27/first-impressions-of-the-macbook-air-11/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since Steve Jobs blessed my MacBook Air and I received it two day early,

I've had almost a week to investigate the 11" MacBook Air. I opted to
max it out, so it has 4GB of RAM, 128GB Solid State Drive (SSD) and the
1.6GHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU. The educational price was \$1,329, which
was almost more than I was willing to spend, but so far, it's been worth
it. The MBA is replacing an original 1.83GHz Intel Core Duo MacBook,
which had been upgraded to 2GB of RAM and a 7,200 RPM 200GB hard drive.
Before I ordered the MBA I did some quick calculations, and CPU wise,
the MBA should be as fast as my old MacBook (the Intel Core 2 Duo is
10-15% faster than the Intel Core Duo, and the MBA has a front bus of
800MHz compared to my MacBook's 667MHz). Adding more memory and the
faster drive, it is faster than the MacBook that replaced it.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the 11"?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing the 11" over the 13" Air models was an easy decision. My goal
was portability. Screen size doesn't really play into it, since at work
I have a 24" LCD and at home I have a 23" LCD. I was never very
impressed with the older 13" Air model. It was still the same size as my
MacBook, only thinner. If screen size does matter to you, I would think
long and hard before I would buy the 13" Air over a MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;Quick!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the machine, the quickness is very surprising. Of course, the SSD
gets most of the credit. When discussing the speed of the machine versus
other Macintosh models, a good analogy is in cars, electric cars versus
gas. Car motor power is measured by two different factors, horsepower
and torque. Horsepower is where you get your speed, and torque is how
fast you can get to your horsepower. Now an interesting thing happens
with electric cars versus gas. In a drag race, the electric car has the
advantage at the start since an electric motor has 100% of its torque
available at 0 RPMs, whereas a gasoline engine requires the motor to hit
a certain number of RPMs before torque is available. Depending on the
length of the race, an electric car can win every time against a more
powerful gasoline powered car. This is the same feeling with the MacBook
Air. With the SSD, the computer is faster than more powerful computers
for a wide range of tasks a user may do during the day. While a core i7
MacBook Pro is going to beat the MacBook Air at rendering video, if the
race is shorter, say launching Safari and browsing the web, the MacBook
Air is going to win. Can this machine be my main machine? It already is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Size wise, it is about as thick as my iPad (in the Apple Case) is, and
weight wise it's pretty much a tie with the iPad. In fact, I handed my
MBA and iPad to my sister-in-law and asked her which was heavier, and
she said the iPad! Although the MBA has about the same depth and
thickness as the iPad, it is around 1.5" longer. Not as portable as the
iPad, but pretty close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen size at first took a little getting used to. I wasn't too
worried about the smaller screen, but the first couple of days of using
it I kept wanting to bump up the font sizes when browsing. This need
went away, and I've now gotten used to the size of the fonts on the
screen. (By the way, when is a browser going to give me the ability to
double-click on an article and have it zoom into that text, like my iPad
and iPod Touch does?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Odds and ends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build quality is excellent, the full size keyboard is great, and the
touchpad is amazing. My extra MacBook charger works with it too! I
ordered mini-display port adapters for \$30 from &lt;a href="http://www.monoprice.com/"&gt;monoprice.com&lt;/a&gt; for
VGA, DVI, and HDMI. Compare that to the \$29 Apple wants for just the
VGA adapter! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ugly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually don't really have any cons against the MacBook Air 11". Twice
I've woken it up and the backlight didn't come on, but it hasn't
happened enough for me to worry about it yet (and I've got 11 more
months to decide whether to buy AppleCare for it :-). It's almost a

What will be announced is anyone's guess, but here's what my intuition
is telling me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new MacBook Air is pretty much a given. The rumors are pretty
    strong that there will be an 11.6" and 13.3" Macbook Air, and that
    they'll be more affordable than the current Air. I'm hoping there is
    an 11.6" because I'm ready to upgrade my original MacBook! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New MacBook Pros. This is something I haven't read anywhere, but I'm
    pretty sure it's going to happen. Why? I ordered two for the school
     district on October 8th with a shipping time of 3-5 days. A week
    later I received a notification that they would ship between Oct.
    21-26. Notice the first day is the day after the Apple Event. And
    now today I received notification that they will not ship until Dec.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple must have something planned for the MacBook Pros, and
originally thought they would be able to ship them on the 21st, but
something happened and they're planning on shipping them 6 weeks
later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS X 10.7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iLife '11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mac App Store - Apple added the ability to sign applications in OS X
    10.5 Leopard, and with the success of the iOS App Store will create
    an App store for the Mac. Unfortunately it will still go through
    iTunes, because for some reason everything has to go through iTunes
    with Apple.&lt;/li&gt;

into 1st grade, I wanted to give her an outlet to publish online. What I
did was set up a Tumblr blog for her at &lt;a href="http://gracyl.ryancollins.org"&gt;gracyl.ryancollins.org&lt;/a&gt;. I
chose Tumblr because it allows her to easily post through email, so she
can post through her computer, my cellphone or her mom's cellphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of setting her up, I decided I wanted a more portable way
for her to write posts. I thought about giving her my 1G iPod Touch, but
went on eBay to look at the iPhone 3G (I wonder how you are supposed to
use the plural of iPhone 3G?). They seem to be selling for right around
\$150, so I bid on a couple and finally won one at \$138. I'm not
planning on activating cell service on it and will use it &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3406"&gt;just like an
iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt;. The advantage of the iPhone 3G of the iPod Touch is the
inclusion of the camera and GPS (I'm not certain the GPS works without
cell service, I guess I'll find out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Tumblr app installed, she will be able to post to her blog
anywhere she has wifi access. I'm excited to see how well it works, and
if she'll stay away from Tap Fish long enough to find out what else the
iPhone can do!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="dd"></category><category term="iPhone"></category><category term="iPod Touch"></category></entry><entry><title>Flowchart: Should you buy an iPad?</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2010/04/09/flowchart-should-you-buy-an-ipad/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-09T12:40:00-04:00</published><updated>2010-04-09T12:40:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2010-04-09:/2010/04/09/flowchart-should-you-buy-an-ipad/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I worked up a little flowchart in Pages on my iPad to help you make your

to focus on my experiences and how I've begun to use the iPad in my home
life and how it may be used in education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase:&lt;br&gt;
I reserved my ipad the day they opened reservations on line so I would
be guaranteed to pick one up on April 3rd. I didn't trust Saturday
delivery, so I headed to Columbus to the Easton Apple Store to stand in
the "privileged line", the one which had the others who had also
reserved their iPad. When we arrived at 7:30am, there were approximately
40 people in the reserved line and about twice that many in the
"unreserved" line, those that were hoping to still pick one up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I bought mine and while my brother and sister played with iPads
in the store, I pulled out my Macbook and setup my iPad. Some reviews
talk about the iPad ready for use right out of the box, but mine popped
up the "connect to iTunes" symbol. The initial sync didn't take long,
but I really wasn't syncing up too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial Impressions:&lt;br&gt;
Fast! It is probably the fastest browsing experience that I've ever
experienced. For the first time it was the speed of the network and not
the hardware slowing me down. The onscreen keyboard isn't that bad, I'm
typing this article on it, but it does take some getting used to. The
biggest problem is keeping your fingers up off the glass so it doesn't
register additional "key" presses. The other issue is that it is
practically impossible to type without looking at the keyboard, so if
you are typing in information that is on paper, it will be a lot slower.
Im debating whether to buy the bluetooth keyboard. I paired it with my
old Think Outside keyboard, which was a piece of cake, but that keyboard
is getting old and the k and l keys do not work the best. I also bought
the Apple case for it, which helps put the iPad at a good angle to use
or type on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer term impressions:&lt;br&gt;
There are more situations where a tablet can be used than a laptop, and
the additional screen space makes the iPad a lot more useful than the
iPod Touch. For example, at a meeting I can have the iPad in my lap or
on the table. Where the iPad shines is when I want to show others
information or something on the screen. I can just hold up the iPad or
hand it to them without the awkwardness one would experience with a
laptop. Maybe it's just the websites I visit, but lack of Flash has not
really been an issue. A lot of the video sites already support HTML 5,
which works flawlessly on the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been impressed with the number of iPad ready apps already in the
app store. Some of my favorite apps, such as Evernote, WordPress, and
iSSH are already available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educational implications:&lt;br&gt;
That being said about Flash above, students would notice the inability
to use some of there favorite sites. Sites such as Starfall, which would
be amazing on the iPad, fail from lack of Flash. The availability of
Pages and Keynote bring some productivity to the iPad, but the clumsy
method of using iTunes to transfer files would hinder their use in the
classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closing thoughts:&lt;br&gt;
I'm going to be posting more as I work with the device longer. I'm
excited to use it to teach a lesson in a kindergarten class to see how
well it will work as a teacher device. Some accessories will probably
end of purchasing include the camera connection kit and the Bluetooth
keyboard. The big unanswered question is "who is the iPad for?", and,
unfortunately I can't answer that yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="iPad"></category><category term="mobile"></category></entry><entry><title>The iPad has landed</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2010/04/03/the-ipad-has-landed/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-03T08:41:00-04:00</published><updated>2010-04-03T08:41:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2010-04-03:/2010/04/03/the-ipad-has-landed/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Braving almost 70? weather I arrived at the Easton Apple store at 7:40

update my status for either Ping.fm account I use the special email
addresses they offer and my email client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem was when I wanted to post the current page I'm reading to
either account. Ping.fm offers a bookmarklet, but it uses the current
logged in ping.fm account, so I would have to continually log in and log
out. I decided to put together my own bookmarklet that starts up a new
mail message in my default email client addressed to the correct Ping.fm
account. To get started, drag the following link to your bookmark bar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:window.location='mailto:YOURPRIVATEPINGADDRESS@ping.fm?body=is%20reading%20\&amp;quot;'+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'\&amp;quot;%20-%20('+encodeURIComponent(window.location)+')'"&gt;Ping.fm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once there, right click on the link, select edit and replace
&lt;strong&gt;YOURPRIVATEPINGADDRESS&lt;/strong&gt; with your private Ping.fm email address (just
the part to the left of the @). Would you like to do it with GMail? Drag
this link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:window.location='https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;tf=1&amp;amp;to=YOURPRIVATEPINGADDRESS@ping.fm&amp;amp;body=is%20reading%20\&amp;quot;'+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'\&amp;quot;%20-%20('+encodeURIComponent(window.location)+')'" title="GMail Ping.fm"&gt;Ping.fm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again, right click on the link, select edit, and replace
&lt;strong&gt;YOURPRIVATEPINGADDRESS&lt;/strong&gt; with your private Ping.fm email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can drag the links multiple times, editing the email address and the
name of the link so you can associate each one with a different Ping.fm
account.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="facebook"></category><category term="ping.fm"></category><category term="twitter"></category></entry><entry><title>Google Teacher Academy for Administrators Video</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2010/01/25/google-teacher-academy-for-administrators-video/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-01-25T21:51:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-01-25T21:51:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2010-01-25:/2010/01/25/google-teacher-academy-for-administrators-video/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've applied to attend the Google Teacher Academy for Administrators,

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I decided to expand my use of Twitter, and began
following more and more people in the education community. This was
awesome, until I realized I could not keep up with the barrage of data
that I was being given. In November I started brainstorming ideas on how
to keep up. I noticed in any of my twitter clients that they were not
grabbing all the tweets that had been posted from the last time I
checked. The reason being is the API only gives you the last 200 tweets,
and for me that was about 40 minutes worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first course of action was to write some software that would grab the
tweets from my [@mr_rcollins][] timeline, parse the info and store it
in a MySQL database. Besides pulling out the data I was interested in of
each tweet, I also stored the complete tweet. This became impractical,
since in a month the complete tweets themselves occupied 4.2GB! I
stopped storing the complete tweets which left me with a 20MB database
after a 5 weeks of collecting, which was a lot more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to start parsing the tweet's text for urls, resolve
any shortened urls, and dump them into another table for me to peruse.
While I got that software working, I came across &lt;a href="http://readtwit.com"&gt;ReadTwit.com&lt;/a&gt;. This
is a great service that will take your timeline, parse out the urls,
resolve shortened links, and give you a RSS feed that you can subscribe
to in your favorite RSS reader (I use &lt;a href="http://google.com/read"&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;. Now I just go
through Reader like normal, and am able to tag/star important sites that
are posted to my Twitter timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article started out as the top ten skills needed to use technology
effectively, but as I wrote the list, I realized that technology
shouldn't be separated out. As we proclaim that technology is a tool, we
also shouldn't single it out when talking about what skills it takes to
educate. The following list has a few items that are somewhat related to
technology, the others are what I view as important skills any teacher
needs to have if they want to succeed. Successful teachers will not find
any surprises in this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. mastery of your subject - If you don't know your subject, your
students will learn that rather quickly. You must know what you're
teaching, backwards and forwards. There are no shortcuts here. If you
cannot answer a student's question, use your searching skills to find
the answer as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. classroom management - Whether it's your morning math meeting or
working in small groups, you will not have a successful class if you
cannot manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Your students don't know as much as you think they do, and you know
more then they think you do - There are a few phrases that have gained
some popularity in the past couple of years that I disagree with. The
impression that teachers are digital immigrants and students are digital
natives is an incorrect assumption. Most students do not know as much as
their teachers when it comes to using technology. And teachers do know
more about technology then they realize. The personal computer is over
30 years old, for a majority of teachers this is longer then their
teaching career. They've seen how technology has changed some
classrooms, and can leverage that experience in their own classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4. Ability to punt - Your day to day classroom will probably never work
exactly as you pictured it in your mind, and your ability to punt and do
something different is imperative. Supplies for a science experiment
hasn't arrived? Prepare to punt. Internet access down? Punt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​5. Keeping an open mind - "&lt;em&gt;Those who say it can't be done, are usually
interrupted by someone doing it"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​6. Understand cheap, fast or easy, pick any two - This is a phrase I
use when talking to administrators when they wonder why something isn't
working the way they thought it should. The phrase basically means, you
can only two out of the three items. For example, if you want it cheap
and easy, it's not going to be fast. Or if you want it fast and easy, it
isn't going to be cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​7. Know how to search - Learn the shortcuts for how to include and
exclude search terms. Find out how to search for a particular filetype.
If you need a presentation on the water cycle, learn how to search for
one (with google use "filetype:ppt" as a search term).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​8. Embracing life-long learning - Anything you learn today will be out
of date before you retire. We don't have to sharpen our quills anymore,
or learn how to make dittos. Be prepared to learn every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​9. Creating a personal learning network - Seek out like minded teachers
as yourself. Email them, follow their blog, follow them on Twitter.
Create your own blog and Twitter account. Learn to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​10. Owning a home computer - I am totally surprised at the number of
teachers that do not own a home computer. The new netbooks are priced at
under \$400 and desktops around the same price, so price isn't much of
an obstacle. If you can't afford to buy, check out your local Freecycle
or Craigslist for people looking at getting rid of older computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything I missed?&lt;/p&gt;

Facebook profile and what they can see on your profile. I suggest you
double-check what is viewable about you. I try to keep my personal FB
totally separate from my &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/facebook"&gt;Facebook Page&lt;/a&gt;, so my profile is pretty much
locked down. Over at &lt;a href="http://www.labnol.org/"&gt;Digital Inspiration&lt;/a&gt; they've written an article

&lt;p&gt;Google has an obsession with speed. In fact, they have found that a .4
second delay in delivering search results causes a 30% drop in click
throughs. They started working on Chrome to deliver a browser that is
fast and secure. It also offers some other advatages such as isolating
each tab or window into separate processes. This means if a tab or
window crashes, it only affects that tab or window. Bookmarks can now be
synched with your Google account, and extensions are starting to become
available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my requirements for a browser is the ability to run multiple
profiles. I have one browser set for personal use and one set for
professional use (I do try to separate the two, although it is difficult

cellphone). Sometimes it would be a message that I would need to act on,
but can't right at that moment. A lot of email clients allow you to flag
a message so you can remember to go back to it, but that's not an option
on my &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/"&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://omnia.samsungmobile.com/"&gt;Omnia&lt;/a&gt;. At first I'd just
mark the messages unread, but that also gets messy (not knowing if I
have new messages because of the unread indicator).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've done now is to create a folder called Flagged for each one of
my email accounts. Now when I get a message I need to act upon it later,
I'll move it to this Flagged folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I will just forward the message to my &lt;a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/"&gt;Remember the Milk&lt;/a&gt;
account, but that's a post for another day. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

open again. It is an online collaborative text editor usable by anyone
with an Internet connection, a browser, and Javascript. There is no sign
up required, you just share a unique URL with the people you want to
collaborate with. Each user is color coded and there is a chat box. You
can use the random URL assigned or make one up just by appending the
name of the document to the end of the url:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;http://etherpad.com/NAMEOFDOCUMENT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It has a couple of advantages of using the word processing aspect of
Google Docs. For starters, it's dead simple to get people involved just
by sharing the url. It is also realtime, you see the edits of the other
people as they make them. There is also a chat box to discuss changes as
you make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also offer a private hosted version, but there isn't any pricing
available on the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some school districts will be wary of using a product that
would allow their students to chat throughout the district, I think the
advantages would outweigh these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uses in the school include after hour editing assistance, a student
could send the link to a document they're working on to their teacher,
and both can work on the document. Also, any group projects could use it
for notes, planning, todo lists, etc., available to all the members of
the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At almost \$500 I don't see it as either. The biggest negative about the
Kindle will also be the last thing fixed, if it is ever addressed, and
that is the ability to re-sell your content (or at least lend it to
others). I'm sure the textbook companies are falling over themselves to
support the Kindle. Here is the ability to sell a text book, with no
production/delivery costs, and then know that the book will not be
resold at the end of the semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper subscription idea has merit, but then again, they need to
lower their subscription rates. I've looked at transferring my USA Today
subscription to digital, but it costs almost the same as getting a paper
copy! At least with the paper copy I can lend/give it to someone else,
or cut out an article to save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is anyone looking at using the Kindle in a school? What would be the
advantages of it over something like a netbook?&lt;/p&gt;

in OS X like Safari, Omniweb, etc. I didn't bother trying to figure out
the problem, until today when I would go to a site in Safari and it
would ask to save the password. I said yes everytime, but it still
didn't save it. Finally I tracked down this blog post, &lt;a href="http://blog.davidohara.net/2007/12/19/os-x-keychain-not-saving-passwords/"&gt;OS X Keychain
Not Saving Passwords…&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggled with this one for about a month before I finally dug into
what was wrong and how to fix it. It all started when I reinstalled
because I couldn’t get BootCamp installed because of volume
fragmentation. Since then, my applications, specifically Mail.app and
Adium, weren’t remembering passwords even if I checked the little
“remember” box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, for some reason, the keychain file at
\~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain was now owned by root instead of by
me. To check and fix from the commandline (&lt;strong&gt;\$&lt;/strong&gt; is the command
prompt):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ls -l ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain -rw-r--r--  1 ryan  admin  781380 Apr  8 11:17 (*deleted...*)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My username is &lt;strong&gt;ryan&lt;/strong&gt;. If it says anything else, use the following to
change the ownership:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ sudo chown ryan ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It will ask for the administrator password, and then change the
ownership of the file. I don't think repair permissions in Disk Utility
would fix this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

Corner-MGuhlin.org, it got me thinking about the vendors in the
education community and some of my pet peeves. My biggest complaint with
education vendors is the lack of pricing transparency. If I'm going to
take the time to visit your website and examine your product, the least
you can do is put some pricing information on your website. For example,
if I'm looking at using a student response system with wireless products
such as Wifi Palms and iPod Touches, I could visit &lt;a href="http://www.polleverywhere.com/"&gt;PollAnywhere.com&lt;/a&gt;,
click on &lt;a href="http://www.polleverywhere.com/plans/retail"&gt;Pricing&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href="http://www.polleverywhere.com/plans/classroom_response_system_k12"&gt;K12&lt;/a&gt; and know exactly how much the
product will cost me. Now I still need to research other solutions, so
let's visit &lt;a href="http://www.turningtechnologies.com/"&gt;Turningpoint.com&lt;/a&gt;. Cool, right in the middle of the front
page they have the &lt;a href="http://www.turningtechnologies.com/interactiveaudienceresponseproducts/responsewareweb.cfm"&gt;product&lt;/a&gt; I want to learn about. Let's see how much
this costs.... ummm... Nothing. I can contact sales, but that's about
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vendors, if you don't list prices, I view that as your solution must be
too expensive for my school district. I'm pressed enough for time, I
don't want to jump through hoops to see if your product is something
that we can use.&lt;/p&gt;

more and more mobile technologies being put into use, it only made sense
to try to find a shorter domain name that we could use to supplement our
current two. Trying to find a shorter .com/.net/.org was futile, so I
started looking at alternative top level domain names, and settled on
&lt;a href="http://kcs.me/"&gt;kcs.me&lt;/a&gt;. Now you can go to &lt;a href="http://kcs.me/"&gt;http://kcs.me/&lt;/a&gt; and it will
automatically redirect to our main page. I haven't started integrating
it into to many other services, but I do plan on setting up our email
accounts so you can use @kcs.me for any current address and it will
work. We also have a custom 404 error page that let's us setup keywords
as shortcuts to commonly used web pages on our website, such as the
user's personal portal page (their MyCatPage, &lt;a href="http://kcs.me/my"&gt;kcs.me/my&lt;/a&gt;) and staff
home pages (&lt;a href="http://kcs.me/collinsr"&gt;kcs.me/collinsr&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia has announced that it plans to power \$99 mobile internet
devices with its Tegra 600 series chips, perhaps as early as this
summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nvidia has announced that it plans to power \$99 mobile internet
devices with its Tegra 600 series chips, perhaps as early as this
summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they can get an Android version released at \$99 that is something
that could be a game changer in education. Although I'm a big fan of the
iPod Touch being an option for a 1-to-1 program, a \$99 device with
keyboard and more openness would easily make one-to-one programs a
reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like I'm always waiting... :-)&lt;/p&gt;

button, one of the options is &lt;strong&gt;Form&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there you can create your form. I only needed two pieces of
information, their name and which class. For the user to enter their
name I created the first item as a text field in which they would enter
their name (and Google makes this easy for you since that's what the
first item defaults to. I did set it to be a required field though. For
the class list I used a dropdown field. Each choice I labeled with the
date of the class, the class title, and the time of the class. I didn't
go into great depths like a description of the class since that is
emailed to the staff and available on the Technology Staff Development
site in Moodle. Now the staff can easily sign up for classes, I can
quickly find out how many people are in each class, and I can remove the
class when the sign up deadline is past or when the class is full. The
spreadsheet can also be used to take attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

Conference&lt;/a&gt; we should be able to use &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/twitterbotphp.zip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to communicate
great things that individuals see throughout the conference. It needed
to be set up easy enough for people that have not been using Twitter to
use. After discussions with John Schinker, they contacted me and I came
up with the idea of a twitter bot that people would follow, and direct
messages to that bot would be sent to all the bot's followers. This way
most people can just follow the bot and get updates, and those that
wanted to send out an update would only need to send a direct message to
the bot with the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the bot works is off of the emails that Twitter sends out when a
Twitter account receives a notification of a new follower or a direct
message. The requirements for the bot are:&lt;br&gt;
• A twitter account (in this case it is etechohio09)&lt;br&gt;
• An email account with POP3 access (in this case a gmail account is
used. This email account address needs to be secret because there isn't
any checking on the validity of where an email came from so this would
allow people without even a Twitter account to spam the bot)&lt;br&gt;
• a unix based host with php at the command line (I use Ubuntu, but it
should work in OS X)&lt;br&gt;
• fetchmail also needs to be available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process to set up the bot is as follows:&lt;br&gt;
1. An email account is set up at gmail. This account must of pop3
turned on, which you can do from the gmail settings.&lt;br&gt;
2. Create a Twitter account, using the above email account. In Twitter
be sure to go to Settings -&gt; Notices and have the notices for followers
and direct messages checked.&lt;br&gt;
3. Set up an account on the unix host for the bot.&lt;br&gt;
4. Login to the account on the unix host.&lt;br&gt;
5. Create the .fetchmailrc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     nano -w .fetchmailrc
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​6. Enter the following lines to that file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     set logfile /home/UNIXACCOUNT/fetchmail.log

     poll &amp;quot;pop.gmail.com&amp;quot; proto POP3 timeout 100 no uidl
     no envelope user &amp;quot;BOTACCOUNT@gmail.com&amp;quot;
     password &amp;quot;BOTPASSWORD&amp;quot; fetchlimit 100 ssl
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​7. Create the logfile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     touch fetchmail.log
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​8. Create the .forward file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     nano -w .forward
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​9. Enter the following line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     |&amp;quot;/home/UNIXACCOUNT/twitterbot.php&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​10. Download [twitterbot.php][], and make it executable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     chmod +x twitterbot.php
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​11. Edit twitterbot.php and enter your Twitter username and password:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     nano twitterbot.php
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​12. Start up fetchmail in daemon mode and your bot should be
functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     fetchmail -d 60
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What will happen is that fetchmail will check the email account every 60
seconds. Any email will be downloaded and each message passed to
twitterbot.php. twitterbot.php will examing the headers for the twitter
command and then act accordingly. If it is a new follower, twitterbot
will start following that person. If it is a direct message, twitterbot
will then post that message to the bot's timeline for all its followers
to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email class used for this twitterbot came from &lt;a href="http://phpclasses.elib.com/browse/file/8922.html"&gt;phpclasses.org&lt;/a&gt;,
modified to pull out a few of the X-headers that Twitter adds so the bot
can figure out the type of message and who is sending it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="email"></category><category term="etech"></category><category term="php"></category><category term="twitter"></category></entry><entry><title>Teacher covers copy costs with ads</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2008/12/02/teacher-covers-copy-costs-with-ads/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-12-02T14:11:00-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-02T14:11:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2008-12-02:/2008/12/02/teacher-covers-copy-costs-with-ads/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2008-12-01-test-ads_N.htm?csp=34"&gt;Ads on tests add up for teacher - USATODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting way to deal with cost cutting, but I don't know the
sustainability of the model. Right now the ads are pretty tame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two-thirds of Farber's ads are inspirational messages
underwritten by parents. Others are ads for local businesses, such as
two from a structural engineering firm and one from a dentist who
urges students, "Brace Yourself for a Great Semester!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have sponsorships in the schools with &lt;a href="http://pepsi.com/"&gt;Pepsi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.coca-cola.com/"&gt;Coke&lt;/a&gt;
vying for exclusivity contracts, but once teachers start advertising,
where does it end? Is there oversight of his ads? What happens and a
religious organization wants to advertise?&lt;/p&gt;

to educational technology, software, and hardware. After some
reflection, I realized that it would make a good series of articles, so
I'm going to write up &lt;strong&gt;How I Work&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is probably the most important component of my technology
arsenal, my &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP31"&gt;Apple MacBook&lt;/a&gt;. During the spring of 2006 I was
researching upgrading my &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/support/imac/g4/"&gt;17" iMac&lt;/a&gt; to a new &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro/"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The plan
was to buy a beefy enough MacBook Pro that I wouldn't want to upgrade
for awhile. I specc'ed out the MacBook Pro that I wanted to be almost
\$2,500! I wasn't happy being stuck with getting such a large laptop,
but I was in luck that Apple then announced the &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP31"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt;. After realizing I could buy a MacBook and an iMac for the same
price as the MacBook Pro, I ordered my &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP31"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt;. After
using it, I realized I didn't even need a desktop at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP31"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/"&gt;VMware Fusion&lt;/a&gt;, I get the best
of all worlds. I run OS X 10.5 mainly, but have a &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/default.mspx"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; virtual machines also installed on the machine. Since the
original purchase I've bumped the memory from 1GB to 2GB and the hard
drive from 80GB to 200GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, come summer 2009 when I'll be looking at upgrading I
don't know what I'll do. The new MacBook's lack of firewire is almost a
deal killer for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am at home I hook my &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP31"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt; up to a 17" LCD

&gt; A new law that takes effect next fall requires every district in the
&gt; state to set up an online school for kindergarten through eighth-grade
&gt; students.
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fascinating to me, and I'm surprised that this didn't get more
news coverage when the legislation was being passed in Florida. Each
district still gets the \$6,000 per student, and most are going to buy
the services of a couple of companies that provide online education
instead of create their own online curriculum. Even the computer and
Internet connection are provided to the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see this being a watershed moment in the aspect of educational
technology. Can education be provided digitally and will students learn
just as well as they do in a classroom of 20 students? The pitfalls are
enormous, mostly centering around socialization skills, although this
should be a solved problem with the years of home schooling that have
taken place. [In the spring of 2003, 1,096,000 students were being home
schooled in the United States][].&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; Parents are being warned to think long and hard when choosing names
&gt; for their babies as research has discovered that girls who are given
&gt; very feminine names, such as Anna, Emma or Elizabeth, are less likely
&gt; to study maths or physics after the age of 16, a remarkable study has

&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fascinating research. They even examined twin girls and found that what
they were named could put them on two entirely different career paths.
Also, naming a child with a 'lower-status' name, spelled in an unusual
way or including punctuation, lowered exam scores by 3-5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing for new parents to worry about. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Happy 35th Birthday Ethernet</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2008/05/24/happy-35th-birthday-ethernet/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-05-24T08:59:00-04:00</published><updated>2008-05-24T08:59:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2008-05-24:/2008/05/24/happy-35th-birthday-ethernet/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div style&gt;

[![][]][]On the Ohio Technology Coordinator's listserv this question was
posted:

&gt; We already had one case of student to teacher generated e-mail that
&gt; originated on a student computer inside the school. The FIRST question
&gt; I got as the Tech Director was 'Why are you allowing students to send
&gt; and receive email in school?'
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my question would be, "Why are you letting them use pencil and
paper? They could be sending notes to other students or staff!". For
discipline we do not distinguish between computer generated or person
generated correspondence. The punishment may change if it's on the
computer because they'd lose computer privileges due to the AUP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're not going to be able to stop it. A student could simply fire up
&lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/wp/2008/04/08/sysk-test-your-smtp-mail-server-with-telnet/"&gt;telnet and use your existing mail server to send email&lt;/a&gt; to whoever
they want, saying anything they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No access to telnet on the machine? Then throw up a Java telnet client
on any old web host and access it from there. Actually, if I wanted to
get around a school's filters, this is the route I'd probably go. Once I
get SSH somewhere, I can get full access to the Internet, and it only
requires port 80, a web browser, and Java. (This is what I use at places
that have network access locked down. I open a SSH tunnel over port 443
to my home computer, and then have full access to anything on the
Internet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is email use part of the State of Ohio Technology Standards, it
is our job as teachers to educate the students on the proper use of
email. How to use it, what's appropriate, etc. Part of the problem with
the garbage that students send through email is that they've never seen
anything else. It's pretty foreign for them to see an email message with
proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation. (I hope I have everything
correct in this post! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet you have students right now using a free email services, ssh
tunnels, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like to think we have things locked down, but unless you're working
for the NSA, you do not have it locked down. Education of the students,
punishment for inappropriate behavior is a good way to go. We as
Technology Coordinators we have a habit of putting up technological road
blocks instead of solving the real problems.&lt;/p&gt;

11-year-old student named Jon Penn stepped in as network manager.&lt;/p&gt;

that it was a pretty cool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Victory Baptist School, a small private school in Sherwood, Ark.,
was struggling to keep its computer network together last year, an
11-year-old student named Jon Penn stepped in as network manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reflection I realized that this story is a big reason why IT
departments are looked down upon as less than professional in
organizations school districts today. For example, replace "network
manager" with "1st grade teacher". Would this student receive accolades
or would the district be singled out as harming the educational
experience of their first graders? What would fellow teachers think of
an 11 year old attempting to do their job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for IT people, if you're doing your job well, it appears
that you're not doing anything at all. Everything just works and people
question why you are getting paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Articles like the above do not help promote the professionalism of IT.
Your boss, upon reading that article, could believe that they could just
hire people off the streets and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As IT professionals, we need to promote and market ourselves, separate
the wheat from the chaff. Anyone can install an Internet appliance, but
it takes a little more knowledge and experience to run the IT department
of a school district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. I don't want to belittle Jon Penn's accomplishments, I wish I
would've had the opportunity at his age.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

necessary to see what the email server is spitting out, just to make
sure everything is working. The easiest way to do that is to use the
&lt;strong&gt;telnet&lt;/strong&gt; command. Telnet allows you to connect to various services on
remote or local machines through the command line. Today we are going to
be using it to send some email. You'll first need to bring up the
command-line on your respective operating system. First see if telnet is
installed. Type:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And you should see something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Welcome to Microsoft Telnet Client&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Escape Character is 'CTRL+]'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Microsoft Telnet&amp;gt;?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Or this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;telnet&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since that works, type &lt;strong&gt;quit&lt;/strong&gt; to exit telnet. Next, we need to open a
connection to our mail server. We will need to know the name or ip
address of the mail server:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;telnet mail.example.com 25&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(The 25 is the port number that SMTP runs on.) You should then get a
response back from your mail server:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Trying 10.0.0.18... Connected to mail.example.com. Escape character is '^]'. 220 mail.example.com ESMTP Postfix&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The server is now waiting for a command. We need to say Hello. &lt;em&gt;(* For
the remaining examples I'm going to use the domain example.com. You'll
need to replace that with your local domain name. *)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;helo example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Which returns:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;250 mail.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The mail server now needs to know who is sending the email:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mail from: myname@example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Returns:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;250 Ok&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Who are you sending the mail to?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;rcpt to: recipient@example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Returns:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;250 Ok&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now it is time to tell it the message:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Returns:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;354 End data with .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Enter your message:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Subject: test message This is a test message .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To end the message, you need to put a period at the beginning of the
line and hit the return key. Now your message is on its way!&lt;br&gt;
Now type quit to exit&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;quit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-style: italic"&gt;Yes I will lead&lt;/span&gt;. The new
category is called Skills You Should Know - SYSK. Little bits of
information that through my experience aren't something that you may not
necessarily use every day, but may someday save you a ton of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's topic is &lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;vi&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Vi&lt;/span&gt; may be the only editor
installed on a new unix based system, and a few commands will get you to
the point where at least you can edit a few files before installing
something a little more user friendly such as pico (or nano).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vi has two modes, command and insertion. It was designed this way
because sometimes the keyboard you would be using might not necessarily
have all the keys we take for granted today, especially when it comes to
the arrow keys. In command mode you can move the cursor around with the
arrow keys or hjkl keys. To do an editing, you'll need to switch to
insertion mode. Vi defaults to command mode when it is started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; - Switches to insertion mode&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;\&lt;ESC\&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - Switches to command
mode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, you'll start the editor with a file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vi somefile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the file is open, you'll press
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; to switch to insertion mode.
Make the changes to your file. Press
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;\&lt;ESC\&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to switch back to command
mode. To exit you'll press the following (these all start with the
colon):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;:wq&lt;/span&gt; - Write the file and then
quit&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;:q!&lt;/span&gt; - Quit the file without
saving the changes. A great way if you mess up and just want to not save
your changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These preceding commands should at least get you started. For more info,

&lt;p&gt;I found one company that already is thinking this way, &lt;a href="http://www.quizzlerpro.com/"&gt;Pocket Mobility
with their Quizzler Pro&lt;/a&gt; product. Me on the other hand, loves the
challenge of coding something up myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone worked with ISRSs? What did you like? What didn't you like?
Is this something I should look at as a summer project? :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 20-minute burst of the 'brain training' exercises on Nintendo's DS
console at the start of the day apparently improves performance in
maths tests by as much as 10 per cent, according to a Scottish study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the completed 10 week study certainly are fascinating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a maths test at the end of the trial, their performance improved by
an average 10 per cent, and the time to complete the test also dropped
from 17 minutes to 13 minutes and nine seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty impressive results, although I don't know what game they're
talking about, unless it happens to be &lt;em&gt;Brain Age 2&lt;/em&gt;. Checking Amazon UK
shows a DS game called &lt;em&gt;More Brain Traing&lt;/em&gt;, which may just be a relabel
&lt;em&gt;Brain Age 2&lt;/em&gt;. I guess I'll have to do some more checking. What a solid
return on your investment though. It would cost a class of 25 \$3,750 to
outfit the entire class with a DS. Throw in the DS Browser and you have
even more ways to integrate it into your classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long until a company comes out with a mobile version of Brain Age 2
that you can play from any mobile computing device?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 25, the U.S. Patent &amp;amp; Trademark Office issued its Non-Final
Action on the re-examination of the Blackboard Patent. We are studying
the document, found here, but in short, the PTO has rejected all 44 of
Blackboard's claims. We caution that this is a NON-final action; both
Blackboard and Desire2Learn will have an opportunity to comment before
a final action will issue, and after that, the decision will be
subject to appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good news, especially not only for Desire2Learn, but also users
of all online coursework delivery systems. Although I'm torn on the idea
of software patents, the ones awarded to Blackboard in my opinion did
not pass the obviousness test. Blackboard has gone on record that they
were not going to go after open source implementations like Moodle, but
I can't help to think that just the idea that Blackboard could sue would
put a damper on some new Moodle installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the technology world it seems we're continually confronted with new
products, services, software, hardware, etc. And for those of us who
have a tough time focusing on one thing at a time, this dizzying array
of choices can easily distract us or keep us from finishing previous
tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/0060005688"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Barry Schwartz it
describes why this is a problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We normally assume in America that more options ("easy fit" or
"relaxed fit"?) will make us happier, but Schwartz shows the opposite
is true, arguing that having all these choices actually goes so far as
to erode our psychological well-being."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a technology coordinator, I'm constantly trying out new things, and
it's very hard to decide whether to actually implement something. Will
this new product be easy enough for staff and students to use? Is the
learning curve mild enough that my users will learn this product and use
it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you ask others in the educational technology community what's the
best wiki, blogging software, operating system, etc. you'll get a ton of
choices. So many choices may ultimately lead you to either never be
satisfied with your final choice, or worse, never make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog I am going to try to only give one or two choices for
solutions to specific problems. They may not be the best choice, but in
the long run, they will be good enough to be of use (I hope).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We already had it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't need anything that fancy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also had FMP Server and FMP Unlimited (version 5.5) so I could
    easily publish the database onto the web, that way it can be updated
    from anywhere with a web connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a big fan of using barcodes on our equipment. Our asset tag
numbers are only 5 digits long, it doesn't take time at all to easily
type them. We do use a barcode reader when inventorying new equipment.
It cuts down on errors when entering serial numbers or MAC addresses.
The barcode reader can read the barcodes right off of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enter new equipment, we use a spreadsheet. Once the spreadsheet is
filled out, it is imported into the FMP database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't track help desk requests along with hardware. We have
approximately 700 machines, and it's very rare that a piece of equipment
will have one hardware failure, let alone multiple failures that need to
be tracked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://glossymolenet.wordpress.com/"&gt;Glossy - MoLeNet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Glossy project will undertake a large-scale development and
implementation of mobile learning across Gloucestershire College
utilising the mobile devices that learners already own. A comparative
study will be made by providing a range of mobile devices for learners
in excluded groups at Gloucestershire College and learners with learning
difficulties and disabilities at National Star College. The project will
put in place an infrastructure that will allow learners using devices
which they already own to access learning activities and content through
a mobile learning portal in conjunction with the college VLE."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very interesting project, to utilize mobile devices that
students already have. I plan on following their blog and am very
interested in their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...which is how in god’s name can we talk seriously about 21st Century
skills for kids if we’re not talking 21st Century skills for educators
first? The more I listened, the less I heard in terms of how we make
the teaching profession as a whole even capable of teaching these
“skills” to kids. Sure, there were mentions of upgrading teacher
preparation programs and giving teachers additional time in the school
day to collaborate, etc. But the URGENCY was all around the kids.
Shouldn’t the URGENCY be all about the teachers right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am absolutely shocked at the lack of technology use by
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;teachers&lt;/span&gt; and
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;technology coordinators&lt;/span&gt;. I've
been to several technology coordinator meetings, there will usually be
30 or 40 tech coordinators in the room, and as I scan the audience,
there are only a handful taking notes into their computer. Most are
writing on yellow legal pads! Maybe I'm using technology for
technology's sake, but I respectfully disagree in this example. By
putting my notes in electronic format I'm already going to be able to
easily file and more importantly find this information at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extends to the eTech Ohio Conference this past February. It seems
that most &lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;teachers&lt;/span&gt; and
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;technology staff&lt;/span&gt;, while promoting
the virtues of technology integration, don't use it themselves. When you
start mentioning RSS, Twitter, Wikis, a lot don't have any clue what
you're talking about. At least most know what blogging is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the solution? &lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Teachers&lt;/span&gt;
need to be shown how, at the very least, technology can save them time.
If technology can save a teacher 10 minutes a day, that 1,830 minutes of
the course of the school year, or 30.5 hours. Even if they need a 4 hour
training on how to save those ten minutes, they still come out ahead! I
believe that once they see that the computer is supposed to save them
time as opposed to taking more time, it will ease further staff
development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Technology Coordinators&lt;/span&gt;, you need
to be guiding the administrators and teachers in your district. If you
don't use technology, then there is less incentive for anyone else to
use it. Automate repetitive tasks. Use RSS. Setup a blog. Subscribe to a
podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;You need to lead.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

such a commodity that the break throughs are getting more and more

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the film, movie-watchers influence one another and
gradually synchronize their emotional responses. This mutual mimicry
also affects each participant's evaluation of the overall experience
-- the more in sync we are with the people around us, the more we like
the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can this research be applied to the classroom? We've all taught at least
one lesson where it seems like everything clicked. The students were
engaged, on task, and excited. Even the most prepared teacher can have a
lesson go south, but it appears that a lesson might be saved by
"groupthink". By slowly bringing the class on task, it can cause a
snowball effect, not only increasing the enjoyment of the students but
also increasing their retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm reminded of this &lt;a href="http://www.edsupport.cc/mguhlin/archives/2007/12/entry_4005.htm" title="Around the Corner - MGuhlin.net : From the Archives: Fire Them"&gt;post by Miguel Guhlin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my early years of working with adult learners, I facilitated a
workshop that was everyone's nightmare class--a cafeteria technology
inservice. In the morning, provide inspiring words about using
technology. In the afternoon, hands-on tutorial. The morning went well
since we had cooperative grouping, activities, etc. The afternoon was
focused on how-to, but I had some physical education coaches that
whipped out newspapers. I was supremely irritated and felt powerless.
It was my first solo workshop for the Education Service Center, and I
wasn't sure what to do...if I'd been working as a school district
facilitator, I know exactly what I would have done--I'd asked them to
leave. Instead, I put up with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a teacher can't "fire" their students, a teacher needs to be
aware of the negative influence those off-task students are having on
the rest of the class.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Headlines"></category></entry><entry><title>Camtasia Studio for free</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2007/11/26/camtasia-studio-for-free/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-11-26T11:53:00-05:00</published><updated>2007-11-26T11:53:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2007-11-26:/2007/11/26/camtasia-studio-for-free/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.edsupport.cc/mguhlin/archives/2007/11/entry_3928.htm"&gt;Miguel Guhlin&lt;/a&gt; who got it from &lt;a href="http://mlearning.edublogs.org/2007/11/23/free-camtasia-studio-313/"&gt;Leonard at the Mobile Learning

&lt;p&gt;Are your meetings worth every penny? Find out with the new Meeting
Miser. Just enter the attendees and start the timer. This handy gadget
knows that time is money and will calculate exactly how much you're
spending ... or wasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site uses actual salary info for your area to calculate the cost per
meeting. I tried it with a typical scenario, 3 elementary teachers and a
principal meeting. The cost came to \$1.41 a minute, or \$84.60 an hour.
An administrator meeting with 4 principals and the superintendent jumps
up to \$2.84 a minute (\$170.40 an hour!). Might be something to bring
up the next time you are sitting in a meeting that isn't accomplishing
anything.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Headlines"></category></entry><entry><title>Websites to create newsletters, brochures, albums, and cards</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2007/09/21/websites-to-create-newsletters-brochures-albums-and-cards/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-09-21T08:52:00-04:00</published><updated>2007-09-21T08:52:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2007-09-21:/2007/09/21/websites-to-create-newsletters-brochures-albums-and-cards/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the NCS-Tech blog: &lt;a href="http://www.ncs-tech.org/?p=928#comment-23850"&gt;Meet your “Maker” - Newsletters, Brochures,

&lt;p&gt;Our culture is obsessed with being busy. When’s the last time you
asked someone about their job or life and they didn’t use the word
busy? It’s worn like a badge of honor. To even hint you might not be
busy, conjures up visions of laziness and lack of ambition. As we plan
various activities and events for schools, I’ll often hear, “that’s a

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google recognizes the central role that teachers play in breaking down
the barriers between people and information, and we support educators
who work each day to empower their students and expand the frontiers
of human knowledge. This website is one of the ways we're working to
bolster that support and explore how Google and educators can work
together.As a start, we're inviting you to share your best ideas for
using technology to innovate in the classroom. To your left, you'll
find a teacher's guide to 12 Google products, including basic
information about each tool, examples of how educators are using them,
and lesson ideas. You'll also find lesson plans and videos from our
partners at Discovery Education focusing on two of our most popular
teaching tools: Google Earth and Google SketchUp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first read it I was expecting a more general view of Internet&lt;br&gt;
resources that may be used in the classroom, but limiting it to Google
products still gives teachers and students some very cool software they
can use. Google Earth is talked about a lot, but I think a lot of people
are missing out learning opportunities that can take place with &lt;a href="http://sketchup.google.com/"&gt;Google
SketchUp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;cite&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what are the features of Star Trek that a person interested in
science can enjoy without guilt, and what features rightly tick off
those persnickety critics? Well, many of the star systems mentioned on
the show, such as Wolf 359, really do exist. Usually, though, the
writers just make them up! There have also been some beautiful special
effects pictures of binary stars and solar flares which were
astronomically accurate and instructive. The best accuracy and worst
stumbles can be found among the features of the show that have becom e
constant through all of the episodes. Here's a list of the standard
Star Trek features, roughly in order of increasing scientific
incredibility:&lt;/p&gt;

activity in which students can demonstrate their skills as scholars":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]Take a group of fifth grade students and break them into groups,
with each group picking a topic that interests them. Any topic.
Dolphins, horses, hockey, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, send the groups of kids to Wikipedia to look up the topic they
selected. [...] The horse, for example, has an extensive entry on the
website. It certainly looks accurate and informative, but is it?
Unfortunately, there are no citations for any of the facts claimed
about horses on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]The group of students breaks down the content on the page into
manageable chunks, each with a certain amount of facts that need to be
verified. The students then spend the necessary time to fact-check the
content.&lt;br&gt;
 Once the Wikipedia entry has been fact-checked, the teacher creates a
Wikipedia login for the class. They go to the entry's talk page and
present their findings, laying out every idea that needs to be
corrected. Then, they edit the actual entry to make the corrections,
with all sources cited. Similarly, for all the parts of the entry
they've verified as accurate, they list sources confirming it.&lt;/p&gt;
