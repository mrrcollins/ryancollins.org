&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though many feel that there are already too many gadgets and too much internet in kids' lives, Arboleda and One Laptop per Child have the opposite viewpoint. He said that a laptop could become a precious, transformational object for a child, taking them to new places in their personal development -- especially if coupled with internet access. As for the sorry state of computer science in schools stateside, Yongpradit emphasized the need for teacher certification programs in computing, building a curriculum the same way math and sciences were: one block at a time. Arboleda took it a step further, saying that access to digital tools and internet has become "a basic human right" -- severely disadvantaging those who lack them.&lt;/p&gt;
