&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the film, movie-watchers influence one another and
gradually synchronize their emotional responses. This mutual mimicry
also affects each participant's evaluation of the overall experience
-- the more in sync we are with the people around us, the more we like
the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can this research be applied to the classroom? We've all taught at least
one lesson where it seems like everything clicked. The students were
engaged, on task, and excited. Even the most prepared teacher can have a
lesson go south, but it appears that a lesson might be saved by
"groupthink". By slowly bringing the class on task, it can cause a
snowball effect, not only increasing the enjoyment of the students but
also increasing their retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm reminded of this &lt;a href="http://www.edsupport.cc/mguhlin/archives/2007/12/entry_4005.htm" title="Around the Corner - MGuhlin.net : From the Archives: Fire Them"&gt;post by Miguel Guhlin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my early years of working with adult learners, I facilitated a
workshop that was everyone's nightmare class--a cafeteria technology
inservice. In the morning, provide inspiring words about using
technology. In the afternoon, hands-on tutorial. The morning went well
since we had cooperative grouping, activities, etc. The afternoon was
focused on how-to, but I had some physical education coaches that
whipped out newspapers. I was supremely irritated and felt powerless.
It was my first solo workshop for the Education Service Center, and I
wasn't sure what to do...if I'd been working as a school district
facilitator, I know exactly what I would have done--I'd asked them to
leave. Instead, I put up with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a teacher can't "fire" their students, a teacher needs to be
aware of the negative influence those off-task students are having on
the rest of the class.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Headlines"></category></entry><entry><title>Are those meetings worth it?</title><link href="http://ryancollins.org/2007/11/06/are-those-meetings-worth-it/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-11-06T12:23:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2007-11-06:2007/11/06/are-those-meetings-worth-it/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.payscale.com/meeting-miser"&gt;PayScale Meeting Miser - Meeting Cost&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are your meetings worth every penny? Find out with the new Meeting
Miser. Just enter the attendees and start the timer. This handy gadget
knows that time is money and will calculate exactly how much you're
spending ... or wasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site uses actual salary info for your area to calculate the cost per
meeting. I tried it with a typical scenario, 3 elementary teachers and a
principal meeting. The cost came to \$1.41 a minute, or \$84.60 an hour.
An administrator meeting with 4 principals and the superintendent jumps
up to \$2.84 a minute (\$170.40 an hour!). Might be something to bring
up the next time you are sitting in a meeting that isn't accomplishing
anything.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Headlines"></category></entry><entry><title>Websites to create newsletters, brochures, albums, and cards</title><link href="http://ryancollins.org/2007/09/21/websites-to-create-newsletters-brochures-albums-and-cards/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-09-21T08:52:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2007-09-21:2007/09/21/websites-to-create-newsletters-brochures-albums-and-cards/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the NCS-Tech blog: &lt;a href="http://www.ncs-tech.org/?p=928#comment-23850"&gt;Meet your “Maker” - Newsletters, Brochures,

asked someone about their job or life and they didn’t use the word
busy? It’s worn like a badge of honor. To even hint you might not be
busy, conjures up visions of laziness and lack of ambition. As we plan

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google recognizes the central role that teachers play in breaking down
the barriers between people and information, and we support educators
who work each day to empower their students and expand the frontiers
of human knowledge. This website is one of the ways we're working to
bolster that support and explore how Google and educators can work
together.As a start, we're inviting you to share your best ideas for
using technology to innovate in the classroom. To your left, you'll
find a teacher's guide to 12 Google products, including basic
information about each tool, examples of how educators are using them,
and lesson ideas. You'll also find lesson plans and videos from our
partners at Discovery Education focusing on two of our most popular
teaching tools: Google Earth and Google SketchUp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first read it I was expecting a more general view of Internet&lt;br /&gt;
resources that may be used in the classroom, but limiting it to Google
products still gives teachers and students some very cool software they
can use. Google Earth is talked about a lot, but I think a lot of people
are missing out learning opportunities that can take place with &lt;a href="http://sketchup.google.com/"&gt;Google

science can enjoy without guilt, and what features rightly tick off
those persnickety critics? Well, many of the star systems mentioned on
the show, such as Wolf 359, really do exist. Usually, though, the
writers just make them up! There have also been some beautiful special
effects pictures of binary stars and solar flares which were
astronomically accurate and instructive. The best accuracy and worst

Asset for Schools&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of blindly following what's in Wikipedia,
use it to present "teachers with an excellent authentic learning
activity in which students can demonstrate their skills as scholars":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]Take a group of fifth grade students and break them into groups,
with each group picking a topic that interests them. Any topic.
Dolphins, horses, hockey, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, send the groups of kids to Wikipedia to look up the topic they
selected. [...] The horse, for example, has an extensive entry on the
website. It certainly looks accurate and informative, but is it?
Unfortunately, there are no citations for any of the facts claimed
about horses on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]The group of students breaks down the content on the page into
manageable chunks, each with a certain amount of facts that need to be
verified. The students then spend the necessary time to fact-check the
content.&lt;br /&gt;
 Once the Wikipedia entry has been fact-checked, the teacher creates a
Wikipedia login for the class. They go to the entry's talk page and
present their findings, laying out every idea that needs to be
corrected. Then, they edit the actual entry to make the corrections,
with all sources cited. Similarly, for all the parts of the entry
they've verified as accurate, they list sources confirming it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Naturally, we were all curious to see what 250 pounds of Silly Putty
would look like, so before distributing the stuff, we put it all in a

entries are located near your home town. It allows anyone one to place
entries on the map, so if your area is blank you can search Wikipedia
for local landmarks and place them on the map yourself. And if the local
landmarks are not in Wikipedia, it would be a great start for your
students to research, edit, and then publish their entry on the landmark
in Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Headlines"></category></entry><entry><title>Cool search site</title><link href="http://ryancollins.org/2005/10/31/cool-search-site/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2005-10-31T16:14:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2005-10-31:2005/10/31/cool-search-site/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've all come to love and rely on &lt;a href="http://google.com/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, but I was alerted to a

and "clusters" the results into different search topics. For example, I
did a search on &lt;a href="http://clusty.com/search?query=volcano"&gt;"volcano"&lt;/a&gt;, and not only did it give me a list of
websites for volcanoes, it gave me some categories to help me refine my
search. These categories included:&lt;br /&gt;
?Hawaii (36)&lt;br /&gt;
?Volcano Observatory (20)&lt;br /&gt;
?Volcano information (16)&lt;br /&gt;
?Geological, Survey (12)&lt;br /&gt;

?Mount St. Helens (9)&lt;br /&gt;
