served us well, even with it being longer than our original k12.oh.us
version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the back of my head I had always wanted a shorter domain, and with
more and more mobile technologies being put into use, it only made sense
to try to find a shorter domain name that we could use to supplement our
current two. Trying to find a shorter .com/.net/.org was futile, so I
started looking at alternative top level domain names, and settled on
&lt;a href="http://kcs.me/"&gt;kcs.me&lt;/a&gt;. Now you can go to &lt;a href="http://kcs.me/"&gt;http://kcs.me/&lt;/a&gt; and it will
automatically redirect to our main page. I haven't started integrating
it into to many other services, but I do plan on setting up our email
accounts so you can use @kcs.me for any current address and it will
work. We also have a custom 404 error page that let's us setup keywords
as shortcuts to commonly used web pages on our website, such as the
user's personal portal page (their MyCatPage, &lt;a href="http://kcs.me/my"&gt;kcs.me/my&lt;/a&gt;) and staff
home pages (&lt;a href="http://kcs.me/collinsr"&gt;kcs.me/collinsr&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your school or business, have you thought about additional domains
or am I just being weird?&lt;/p&gt;
