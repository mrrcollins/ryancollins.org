As I've attended numerous conferences throughout my professional career, I've started to realize I should create a to do list so I don't forget anything before a conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;1. Charge my devices and battery packs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My usual compliment of devices I take to a conference consists of my laptop, iPad, and iPhone. Along with charging them, I also have a battery case for my iPhone and a Jackery Giant USB battery pack that needs to be charged. Multi-day conferences are not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2. Set up IFTTT to capture my notes and tweets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started to use Twitter to write my notes during a conference and  &lt;a href="http://ifttt.com"&gt;If This Then That&lt;/a&gt; to capture them. The recipe I use looks for any of my tweets with the conference hashtag, and if found, it appends that tweet to a text file in &lt;a href="http://dropbox.com"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the conference I'll have an entire text file with everything I want to save from the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IFTTT Hashtag Recipe" src="http://dl.ryancollins.org/Screen%20Shot%202014-05-02%20at%207.56.07%20AM.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3. Set up a keyboard shortcut for the conference hashtag&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hashtag for the conference Saturday is #iPadSymposiumUA. What I did on my iPhone and iPad is create a keyboard shortcut (Settings -&amp;gt; General -&amp;gt; Keyboard -&amp;gt; Shortcuts). The shortcut is &lt;strong&gt;iii&lt;/strong&gt; which expands to #iPadSymposiumUA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;4. Charge my name tag&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name tag I've started to use is a 4 generation iPod Touch running Keynote. I have a lanyard that connects to the dock connector, and I created a 3 slide presentation that continually loops. Keynote keeps the display on while showing a presentation. If I shut it off during sessions, the battery lasts an entire day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;5. Gas up the car, get some cash and Ho Hos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, how frustrating it can be to get in your car for a multi-hour trip and realize you have to stop for gas. Even though I hardly use cash anymore, it's a good idea to have a few bucks on you, just in case. The Ho Hos? They're self explanatory. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="conference"></category><category term="checklist"></category><category term="eduk8me"></category></entry><entry><title>Getting ready for the Ohio Educational Technology Conference #oetc14</title><link href="http://ryancollins.org/2014/01/26/getting-ready-for-the-ohio-educational-technology-conference-oetc14/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-01-26T14:22:40-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2014-01-26:2014/01/26/getting-ready-for-the-ohio-educational-technology-conference-oetc14/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My presentations are.... Well, let's say there are slides and an outline, but they will never be finished. I will be constantly tweaking until I present, and then I'll have presenters remorse afterwards of missed opportunities. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday I will be presenting &lt;a href="http://s19.a2zinc.net/clients/etechohio/OETC2014/Public/SessionDetails.aspx?FromPage=SpeakerList.aspx&amp;amp;SessionID=844"&gt;Teach Like a Hacker&lt;/a&gt; in room C213-C214 at 2:15. You too can hack, come! For those that can't attend, I'll be posting my slides tomorrow and the &lt;a href="http://talk.eduk8.me/"&gt;chat room will be open&lt;/a&gt; the entire conference (chat room is also accessible over IRC, server is talk.eduk8.me, channel is #tlah). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday is a big day with the ALTconference, OETCx. Come and watch the keynote with your fellow OETC participants. It's a different experience being able to hold conversations while watching the keynote. I'll be presenting an Ignite style FRED talk that afternoon which will be exciting since it involves Star Wars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join 1,486 others that follow my tweets &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mr_rcollins"&gt;@mr_rcollins&lt;/a&gt;. Other important accounts are the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/oetcx"&gt;@oetcx&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ohedtech"&gt;@OhEdTech&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account, my &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://oetcx.com"&gt;OETCx website&lt;/a&gt;. The conference hashtags #oetc14, #oetcx, and my session hashtag #tlah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see me, be sure to stop and say hi! &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="oetc14"></category><category term="oetcx"></category><category term="conference"></category></entry></feed>
