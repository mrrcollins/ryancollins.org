and it seems like every four months someone is asking about what product
to get to use for inventory control. I created a &lt;a href="http://helpdesk.kentoncityschools.org/TechInventory.fp5"&gt;simple database in
Filemaker Pro&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of our inventory. Why Filemaker Pro?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We already had it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't need anything that fancy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also had FMP Server and FMP Unlimited (version 5.5) so I could
    easily publish the database onto the web, that way it can be updated
    from anywhere with a web connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a big fan of using barcodes on our equipment. Our asset tag
numbers are only 5 digits long, it doesn't take time at all to easily
type them. We do use a barcode reader when inventorying new equipment.
It cuts down on errors when entering serial numbers or MAC addresses.
The barcode reader can read the barcodes right off of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enter new equipment, we use a spreadsheet. Once the spreadsheet is
filled out, it is imported into the FMP database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't track help desk requests along with hardware. We have
approximately 700 machines, and it's very rare that a piece of equipment
will have one hardware failure, let alone multiple failures that need to
be tracked.&lt;/p&gt;
