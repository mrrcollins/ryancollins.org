It consists of a series of 45-6o mile bike rides over the course of a week. During our numerous downtimes, I was having a discussion with my uncle about robots and automated drivers. As we were talking, there was a point I wanted to make but I couldn't quite remember the information I wanted to use so I told him I "had to look it up". Of course, his reply was "What did you do before smartphones". It was at this moment I realized that the smartphone wasn't a crutch. If it wasn't for the smartphone, I wouldn't have know the information existed in the first place. I use my smartphone for making available to me the information that is available. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="memorization"></category><category term="google"></category><category term="search"></category></entry></feed>
