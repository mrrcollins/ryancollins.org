head wrapped around all the information I collected! I did learn one
very important thing. My ID badge this year said Librarian/Media
Specialist, and I learned that it makes it a lot easier to walk through
the vendor area. They didn't seem as interested in talking to me. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm hoping to get more things put together and online. I still have to
collect the notes from my session and put them online, and also to tag
them into del.icio.us (thanks Alvin!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year I go hoping to take away one new thing to get excited about,
but that is getting harder to do. Technology in education has become
such a commodity that the break throughs are getting more and more
uncommon. I'm also torn with the problem of too many choices. It's hard
for me to focus on one thing, I want to implement them all!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2008 12:19:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2008-02-12:2008/02/12/etech-ohio-conference-2008-thoughts/</guid><category>From Mobile</category></item></channel></rss>
