&lt;p&gt;With my history files saved in ~/.bash_history_log/ I needed a different solution. The one I came up with is &lt;code&gt;grep -ri COMMAND ~/.bash_history_log/*&lt;/code&gt;.  That seems awfully long, lets make it shorter. You can't pass arguments to bash aliases, but you can to functions. In .bash_profile (or .bashrc, which ever runs for you by default) I added the following function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;function searchhistory() {
    grep -ri &amp;quot;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot; ~/.bash_history_log/*
}
alias shistory=searchhistory
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And now a simple &lt;code&gt;shistory COMMAND&lt;/code&gt; is all it takes to find that command I ran a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="bash"></category><category term="history"></category></entry><entry><title>History teacher and class discover Boston's own Forest Gump</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/09/20/history-teacher-and-class-discover-bostons-own-forest-gump/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-20T18:14:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-09-20T18:14:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-09-20:/2013/09/20/history-teacher-and-class-discover-bostons-own-forest-gump/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2013/09/03/martin-w-joyce-the-briefcase/"&gt;The Briefcase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In a way Delaney couldn't have imagined when he first popped open the suitcase that day, Joyce would turn out to be something akin to Boston's own Forrest Gump, a perfect set of eyes through which to visit America's past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What an amazing find and a great way to engage the students!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="history"></category><category term="research"></category></entry></feed>
