&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though many feel that there are already too many gadgets and too much internet in kids' lives, Arboleda and One Laptop per Child have the opposite viewpoint. He said that a laptop could become a precious, transformational object for a child, taking them to new places in their personal development -- especially if coupled with internet access. As for the sorry state of computer science in schools stateside, Yongpradit emphasized the need for teacher certification programs in computing, building a curriculum the same way math and sciences were: one block at a time. Arboleda took it a step further, saying that access to digital tools and internet has become "a basic human right" -- severely disadvantaging those who lack them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of a custom Java applet, he was able to get kindergartners to write a tic-tac-toe program, based on step-by-step rules the students formulated as a group. And using colored balls and string, he taught the kids how to create graph algorithms, an essential component of computer science. “We believe our work shows that you can start teaching computer science before students even know how to read and write,” Gibson (who now teaches in France) wrote in a 2012 paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree with the title, but not with the content. How young do you start teaching coding?&lt;/p&gt;
