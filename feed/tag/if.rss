&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read three novels: &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt;. I usually get so caught up with non-fiction (including all my RSS feeds) that I don't read as much fiction as I should. There really isn't any particular reason for reading these, except for the fact that two of them have movies in 2013.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write an interactive fiction game in Inform 7. Interactive fiction may be somewhat of a dead genre but I think it's a fascinating way to create a story. I bought &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Creating-Interactive-Fiction-Inform-7/dp/1435455061"&gt;Creating Interactive Fiction with Inform 7 by Aaron Reed&lt;/a&gt; in September of 2010. I think it's about time to put it to use!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;a href="http://www.littlefreelibrary.org/"&gt;Little Free Library&lt;/a&gt;. These are the book equivalent of take a penny/leave a penny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish my super secret web tool.... :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there anything you're doing this summer?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2013 09:13:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-06-28:2013/06/28/my-summer-plans-2013/</guid><category>if</category><category>inform</category><category>reading</category><category>books</category><category>library</category></item></channel></rss>
