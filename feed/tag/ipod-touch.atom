into 1st grade, I wanted to give her an outlet to publish online. What I
did was set up a Tumblr blog for her at &lt;a href="http://gracyl.ryancollins.org"&gt;gracyl.ryancollins.org&lt;/a&gt;. I
chose Tumblr because it allows her to easily post through email, so she
can post through her computer, my cellphone or her mom's cellphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of setting her up, I decided I wanted a more portable way
for her to write posts. I thought about giving her my 1G iPod Touch, but
went on eBay to look at the iPhone 3G (I wonder how you are supposed to
use the plural of iPhone 3G?). They seem to be selling for right around
\$150, so I bid on a couple and finally won one at \$138. I'm not
planning on activating cell service on it and will use it &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3406"&gt;just like an
iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt;. The advantage of the iPhone 3G of the iPod Touch is the
inclusion of the camera and GPS (I'm not certain the GPS works without
cell service, I guess I'll find out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Tumblr app installed, she will be able to post to her blog
anywhere she has wifi access. I'm excited to see how well it works, and
if she'll stay away from Tap Fish long enough to find out what else the
iPhone can do!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="dd"></category><category term="iPhone"></category><category term="iPod Touch"></category></entry><entry><title>Organize your email with a Flagged folder</title><link href="http://ryancollins.org/2009/05/12/organize-your-email-with-a-flagged-folder/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-05-12T11:51:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2009-05-12:2009/05/12/organize-your-email-with-a-flagged-folder/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have multiple email accounts, and read it from various devices. It's
all based on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imap"&gt;IMAP&lt;/a&gt;, so folders, messages read, etc. stay the same
from device to device. The problem I was having was when I'd read a
message on my &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/"&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://omnia.samsungmobile.com/"&gt;Samsung Omnia&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/default.mspx"&gt;Windows Mobile&lt;/a&gt;
cellphone). Sometimes it would be a message that I would need to act on,
but can't right at that moment. A lot of email clients allow you to flag
a message so you can remember to go back to it, but that's not an option
on my &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/"&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://omnia.samsungmobile.com/"&gt;Omnia&lt;/a&gt;. At first I'd just
mark the messages unread, but that also gets messy (not knowing if I
have new messages because of the unread indicator).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've done now is to create a folder called Flagged for each one of
my email accounts. Now when I get a message I need to act upon it later,
I'll move it to this Flagged folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I will just forward the message to my &lt;a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/"&gt;Remember the Milk&lt;/a&gt;
account, but that's a post for another day. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

devices in our classrooms, it hit me that they could be used as an
interactive student response system (ISRS). Since current ISRSs are
around \$100 per person, why not invest in a more useful device such as
the iPod Touch, Sony PSP, or Nintendo DS (with Opera)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found one company that already is thinking this way, &lt;a href="http://www.quizzlerpro.com/"&gt;Pocket Mobility
with their Quizzler Pro&lt;/a&gt; product. Me on the other hand, loves the
challenge of coding something up myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone worked with ISRSs? What did you like? What didn't you like?
Is this something I should look at as a summer project? :-)&lt;/p&gt;

school, middle school, and elementary level. Stealing some ideas from
&lt;a href="http://staff.bbhcsd.org/schinkerj/archives/2008/02/14/i-want-my-eeepc/" title="John Schinker"&gt;John Schinker&lt;/a&gt;, I'm putting forth the following questions for the
participants to answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does this device work well enough to have a place in our schools?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How could this be used effectively with students?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What limitations are there that would affect its usefulness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there solutions to overcome those limitations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What technical hurdles would have to be overcome to make the use of
these devices successful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If we were to start using these computers, what could they replace?
What could we buy fewer of to make this cost effective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are these durable enough for student use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the iPod Touch too complicated / different / cumbersome / annoying
to be used in this environment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started to come up with some ideas on how they can be used. My main
goal to start is to focus mainly on communication. I've setup the
Prologue theme for Wordpress, and am currently recruiting teachers to
try it out. I've also installed the &lt;a href="http://www.elgg.org/" title="Elgg.org"&gt;Elgg.org&lt;/a&gt; Open Source social
network software at the HS and am investigating ways that it can be used
in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are some of the important aspects that you can see implementing
with a 1-to-1 program?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s. I'm trying out publishing from Google Docs, let's see how well that
