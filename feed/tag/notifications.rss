For iOS there are apps such as Boxcar, Pushover, and App Notifications. These apps are nice and do the job, but they require a little more setup and/or they cost. As I was working on my iPhone for a replacement, I realized that the built in email app can have different notification types for each email account (such as sound, vibration, etc). So I started to play around, and set up a different Yahoo! account to use for notifications on my phone. My email accounts are set to silent, except for this new Yahoo! account and my VIP list. Now when I want to be notified right away, I use this email account. Under GMail I filter emails from various accounts and forward them to my new email account. As soon as I get them, I get a new notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This convoluted mess could be done with the VIP list feature of iOS, but I wanted to separate my VIPs from other notifications.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2013 10:35:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-09-17:2013/09/17/tlah-push-notifications-on-the-cheap/</guid><category>notifications</category><category>email</category><category>ios</category></item><item><title>Take control of your notifications</title><link>http://ryancollins.org/2013/08/27/take-control-of-your-notifications/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Interruptions are deadly. Well, maybe that's a little bit of exaggeration. But even &lt;a href="http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2013/brief-interruptions-spawn-errors/"&gt;three second interruptions can cause problems&lt;/a&gt;. I've decided to take back the notifications on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First stop was the phone ringer. Apple doesn't have a silent ringtone on the iPhone, so I had to search. In my searching I came across the article &lt;a href="http://richardkmiller.com/702/iphone-tip-use-a-silent-ringtone-to-screen-calls-in-your-sleep"&gt;iPhone tip: Use a Silent Ringtone to Screen Calls in Your Sleep&lt;/a&gt;. It not only contained the silent ringtone but also directions on using it. My default ringtone is silence, and a different ringtone is set for those people for which my phone should always right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was text alerts. The iPhone has a silent text alert, so that part was easier than the ringtone. Then I also went in and added a tone for just a few people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I went into Settings -&amp;gt; Notifications and turned off the sound notifications for most of my applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have a nice, mostly silent phone which &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/2013/08/27/dont-interrupt-me/"&gt;doesn't interrupt me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2013 10:00:30 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-08-27:2013/08/27/take-control-of-your-notifications/</guid><category>ios</category><category>notifications</category><category>annoyances</category></item></channel></rss>
