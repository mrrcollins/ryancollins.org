devices in our classrooms, it hit me that they could be used as an
interactive student response system (ISRS). Since current ISRSs are
around \$100 per person, why not invest in a more useful device such as
the iPod Touch, Sony PSP, or Nintendo DS (with Opera)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found one company that already is thinking this way, &lt;a href="http://www.quizzlerpro.com/"&gt;Pocket Mobility
with their Quizzler Pro&lt;/a&gt; product. Me on the other hand, loves the
challenge of coding something up myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone worked with ISRSs? What did you like? What didn't you like?
Is this something I should look at as a summer project? :-)&lt;/p&gt;

with Dr Kawashima' on the Nintendo DS][] in 16 schools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 20-minute burst of the 'brain training' exercises on Nintendo's DS
console at the start of the day apparently improves performance in
maths tests by as much as 10 per cent, according to a Scottish study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the completed 10 week study certainly are fascinating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a maths test at the end of the trial, their performance improved by
an average 10 per cent, and the time to complete the test also dropped
from 17 minutes to 13 minutes and nine seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty impressive results, although I don't know what game they're
talking about, unless it happens to be &lt;em&gt;Brain Age 2&lt;/em&gt;. Checking Amazon UK
shows a DS game called &lt;em&gt;More Brain Traing&lt;/em&gt;, which may just be a relabel
&lt;em&gt;Brain Age 2&lt;/em&gt;. I guess I'll have to do some more checking. What a solid
return on your investment though. It would cost a class of 25 \$3,750 to
outfit the entire class with a DS. Throw in the DS Browser and you have
even more ways to integrate it into your classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long until a company comes out with a mobile version of Brain Age 2
that you can play from any mobile computing device?&lt;/p&gt;
