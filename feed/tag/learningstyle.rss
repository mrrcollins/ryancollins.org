&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been battling the notion of "designing instruction for learning styles" in my own quixotic fashion for a couple of decades now. In my attempt to be a good steward of my clients' shareholders' equity I wished to help them avoid faddish instructional design practices that have been disproven by empirical research. I first learned back in the 1980s at NSPI (now ISPI) conferences that while self-reported learning style preferences do exist, that designing instruction to accommodate them has no basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, research dates back 30 years yet we still hear about accommodating the different learning styles.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2013 20:53:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-11-03:2013/11/03/the-learning-style-myth/</guid><category>learningstyle</category></item></channel></rss>
