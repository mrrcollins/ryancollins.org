This is pretty amazing, we can finally keep all of our Macs on the same OS instead of us currently supporting three different versions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for hackintosh users, it means that there is no longer a way to purchase a legal copy of OS X. A hackintosh is a computer that is assembled out of parts that can be made to run OS X. It's a way to get a Mac without paying for a Mac. A lot of users of hackintosh like the challenge, like OS X, but for the most part Apple doesn't offer a hardware configuration for them. That ends now for those that try to stay as legal as possible, although a hackintosh was never quite legal. The OS X terms of service require OS X to be used on Apple labeled computers, which means even if you buy a copy it's still not quite legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is probably not what Apple had in mind, it is the end of an era.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="osx"></category><category term="apple"></category><category term="hackintosh"></category></entry></feed>
