&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I answered that most were beginners, and some were intermediate. Then I said that none were advanced. Do you know of any districts or schools in Ohio that are advanced with technology integration? Responding to comments I started to try to picture what advanced means. I guess at the basic level advanced means that students are creating more than consuming. Creating in this sense means more than just using an office suite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are other aspects of advanced? Maker spaces? Coding? Digital publishing and story telling? What else?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="edtech"></category><category term="integration"></category></entry><entry><title>Technology and Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/10/02/technology-and-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-10-02T10:36:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-10-02T10:36:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-10-02:/2013/10/02/technology-and-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://site.xavier.edu/crable/IT_Value_Maslow.pdf"&gt;The IT Value Hierarchy: Using Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs as a Metaphor for Gauging the Maturity Level of Information Technology Use within Competitive Organizations&lt;/a&gt;(PDF)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although information technology products and services may be equally available, the innovative use of IT to create competitive differentiation has clearly been achieved y many organizations. What IT executives often lack is a contextual framework in which to explain the path to increasing value for their firms. The authors believe that this framework can be explained through the use of a needs hierarchy based on a comparison to the human psychological needs hierarchy described by Abraham Maslow more than sixty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallels to technology in education is uncanny. This paper provides a nice framework for the technology planning process. Just replace &lt;strong&gt;IT executives&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;staff, administration, BOE, and community&lt;/strong&gt;. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="maslow"></category><category term="integration"></category></entry><entry><title>Why are you integrating technology?</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/09/23/why-are-you-integrating-technology/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-23T10:37:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-09-23T10:37:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-09-23:/2013/09/23/why-are-you-integrating-technology/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://georgecouros.ca/blog/archives/4125"&gt;School plus&lt;/a&gt; I have a new favorite quote for today:&lt;/p&gt;
