The big one was working on getting an [interactive whiteboard setup
going with a Nintendo Wiimote and an infrared pen][]. This morning, I
finally got my infrared pen working. What I did was bought a cheap LED
flashlight from Walmart and replaced one of the LEDs with an infrared
LED, the Radio Shack 276-143 to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After checking that the pen worked, I downloaded the &lt;a href="http://www.uweschmidt.org/wiimote-whiteboard"&gt;Wiimote
interactive whiteboard software&lt;/a&gt; and it worked! I'll try to get some
pictures and a video up, but I don't know if I'll have time today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next goal is to find some whiteboard software to use with it. For right
now I'm just using &lt;a href="http://www.inkscape.org/"&gt;Inkscape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
