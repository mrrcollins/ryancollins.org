Well, maybe that's a little bit of exaggeration. But even &lt;a href="http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2013/brief-interruptions-spawn-errors/"&gt;three second interruptions can cause problems&lt;/a&gt;. I've decided to take back the notifications on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First stop was the phone ringer. Apple doesn't have a silent ringtone on the iPhone, so I had to search. In my searching I came across the article &lt;a href="http://richardkmiller.com/702/iphone-tip-use-a-silent-ringtone-to-screen-calls-in-your-sleep"&gt;iPhone tip: Use a Silent Ringtone to Screen Calls in Your Sleep&lt;/a&gt;. It not only contained the silent ringtone but also directions on using it. My default ringtone is silence, and a different ringtone is set for those people for which my phone should always right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was text alerts. The iPhone has a silent text alert, so that part was easier than the ringtone. Then I also went in and added a tone for just a few people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I went into Settings -&amp;gt; Notifications and turned off the sound notifications for most of my applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have a nice, mostly silent phone which &lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/2013/08/27/dont-interrupt-me/"&gt;doesn't interrupt me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2013 10:00:30 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-08-27:2013/08/27/take-control-of-your-notifications/</guid><category>ios</category><category>notifications</category><category>annoyances</category></item></channel></rss>
