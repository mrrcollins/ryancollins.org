The easiest way to backup your subscriptions from Google Reader is to use &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/takeout/?pli=1"&gt;Google Takeout&lt;/a&gt;. This will give you a .zip file with a lot of data, including a subscriptions.xml which you can import into any RSS reader that accepts an OPML file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is fine for your list of subscriptions, but I have been using Google Reader as a particular search engine, allowing me to search for items that I have read. I lost this ability with Google Takeout, but then I came across &lt;a href="http://readerisdead.com/"&gt;Reader is Dead&lt;/a&gt;. Mihai Parparita has created a couple of scripts that back up not only your subscriptions, but also all the items in Google Reader. For me, it was 928,981 items to be downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under OS X the script ran right out of the box. If you are on Windows, you will need to install Python first.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="rss"></category><category term="googlereader"></category></entry></feed>
