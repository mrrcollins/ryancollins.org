&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like technology itself, the job description of the district chief technology officer is changing rapidly—and often dramatically—as public education transforms around it, and through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why keeping up with the demands of the K-12 CTO's job can be difficult, because relatively few of these professionals are schooled in the perfect marriage of skills on the instructional and technical sides to make the best decisions for districts.&lt;/p&gt;
