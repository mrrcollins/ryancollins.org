&lt;p&gt;At this point in your life, Outlook may be familiar, which we can often confuse with productive or well designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point in your life, Outlook may be familiar, which we can often confuse with productive or well designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have you been faced with a change in software or hardware, and

gestures of The Itsy-Bitsy Pterodactyl. There was a similar outcry when we
moved away from Outlook’s suite-mates in the Microsoft Office dreadnaught. But

Ayn Randian Objectivism, the time has come to move on, commrade.&lt;/p&gt;
