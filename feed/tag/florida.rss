&gt; A new law that takes effect next fall requires every district in the
&gt; state to set up an online school for kindergarten through eighth-grade
&gt; students.
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fascinating to me, and I'm surprised that this didn't get more
news coverage when the legislation was being passed in Florida. Each
district still gets the \$6,000 per student, and most are going to buy
the services of a couple of companies that provide online education
instead of create their own online curriculum. Even the computer and
Internet connection are provided to the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see this being a watershed moment in the aspect of educational
technology. Can education be provided digitally and will students learn
just as well as they do in a classroom of 20 students? The pitfalls are
enormous, mostly centering around socialization skills, although this
should be a solved problem with the years of home schooling that have
taken place. [In the spring of 2003, 1,096,000 students were being home
schooled in the United States][].&lt;/p&gt;
