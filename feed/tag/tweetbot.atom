Unfortunately, they changed one of the best features of Tweetbot. Lists were treated as a first class citizen. You could replace your Timeline with any of your lists with two taps. Now they have moved lists to one of the tabs at the bottom of the screen and made cumbersome to work with lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like a lot of the changes, but I have re-installed The older version of Tweetbot and have switched back to it. If you heavily use lists I'd be hesitant to upgrade. I don't mind paying the price for the newer version, except I don't expect to lose features. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="iOS"></category><category term="twitter"></category><category term="tweetbot"></category></entry></feed>
