&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults have worn their computer illiteracy as a badge of pride for many years now so it shouldn't surprise anyone that their children share their digital inadequacies. Moreover, neither group is even willing to try to solve a problem when they encounter it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As recent privacy and malware issues have demonstrated, there is a price to be paid for computer illiteracy. And nobody should ever be proud of being ignorant. If not knowing something is a nonissue, then it's a nonissue, but don't brag about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm seeing this more and more, people expect to be spoon fed and once you get to the third step, they believe it's too hard to do and shut down.  Are you seeing this in your district?&lt;/p&gt;
