&lt;p&gt;When using with an older Macintosh, you may have an issue when it comes to initializing and using a non-Apple drive. The first time, Apple HD SC Setup wouldn't find the drive. I then found this &lt;a href="https://68kmla.org/forums/index.php?/topic/24810-questions-about-scsi2sd-setup-in-mac-lc-iii/"&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt;. I followed dougg3's directions when setting up the SCSI2SD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the vendor to the string " SEAGATE" (yes, there is a single space in front of SEAGATE for a total of 8 characters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the product ID to the string "          ST225N" (10 spaces in front for a total of 16 characters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the revision to the string "1.0 " (with a space after, for a total of 4 characters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple HD SC Setup then saw the drive. The other thing I had to do was re-partition the drive after it set it up, since Apple HD SC Setup only create a 16MB partition and left the rest of the drive unpartitioned. I deleted that partition and then created a 256MB partition.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="scsi"></category><category term="scis2sd"></category></entry></feed>
