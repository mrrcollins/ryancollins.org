It consists of a series of 45-6o mile bike rides over the course of a week. During our numerous downtimes, I was having a discussion with my uncle about robots and automated drivers. As we were talking, there was a point I wanted to make but I couldn't quite remember the information I wanted to use so I told him I "had to look it up". Of course, his reply was "What did you do before smartphones". It was at this moment I realized that the smartphone wasn't a crutch. If it wasn't for the smartphone, I wouldn't have know the information existed in the first place. I use my smartphone for making available to me the information that is available. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2013 14:52:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-09-01:2013/09/01/let-me-look-that-up/</guid><category>memorization</category><category>google</category><category>search</category></item></channel></rss>
