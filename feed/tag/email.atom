For iOS there are apps such as Boxcar, Pushover, and App Notifications. These apps are nice and do the job, but they require a little more setup and/or they cost. As I was working on my iPhone for a replacement, I realized that the built in email app can have different notification types for each email account (such as sound, vibration, etc). So I started to play around, and set up a different Yahoo! account to use for notifications on my phone. My email accounts are set to silent, except for this new Yahoo! account and my VIP list. Now when I want to be notified right away, I use this email account. Under GMail I filter emails from various accounts and forward them to my new email account. As soon as I get them, I get a new notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This convoluted mess could be done with the VIP list feature of iOS, but I wanted to separate my VIPs from other notifications.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notifications"></category><category term="email"></category><category term="ios"></category></entry><entry><title>Organize your email with a Flagged folder</title><link href="https://ryancollins.org/2009/05/12/organize-your-email-with-a-flagged-folder/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-12T11:51:00-04:00</published><updated>2009-05-12T11:51:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2009-05-12:/2009/05/12/organize-your-email-with-a-flagged-folder/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have multiple email accounts, and read it from various devices.

cellphone). Sometimes it would be a message that I would need to act on,
but can't right at that moment. A lot of email clients allow you to flag
a message so you can remember to go back to it, but that's not an option
on my &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/"&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://omnia.samsungmobile.com/"&gt;Omnia&lt;/a&gt;. At first I'd just
mark the messages unread, but that also gets messy (not knowing if I
have new messages because of the unread indicator).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've done now is to create a folder called Flagged for each one of
my email accounts. Now when I get a message I need to act upon it later,
I'll move it to this Flagged folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I will just forward the message to my &lt;a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/"&gt;Remember the Milk&lt;/a&gt;
account, but that's a post for another day. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

Conference&lt;/a&gt; we should be able to use &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/twitterbotphp.zip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to communicate
great things that individuals see throughout the conference. It needed
to be set up easy enough for people that have not been using Twitter to
use. After discussions with John Schinker, they contacted me and I came
up with the idea of a twitter bot that people would follow, and direct
messages to that bot would be sent to all the bot's followers. This way
most people can just follow the bot and get updates, and those that
wanted to send out an update would only need to send a direct message to
the bot with the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the bot works is off of the emails that Twitter sends out when a
Twitter account receives a notification of a new follower or a direct
message. The requirements for the bot are:&lt;br&gt;
• A twitter account (in this case it is etechohio09)&lt;br&gt;
• An email account with POP3 access (in this case a gmail account is
used. This email account address needs to be secret because there isn't
any checking on the validity of where an email came from so this would
allow people without even a Twitter account to spam the bot)&lt;br&gt;
• a unix based host with php at the command line (I use Ubuntu, but it
should work in OS X)&lt;br&gt;
• fetchmail also needs to be available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process to set up the bot is as follows:&lt;br&gt;
1. An email account is set up at gmail. This account must of pop3
turned on, which you can do from the gmail settings.&lt;br&gt;
2. Create a Twitter account, using the above email account. In Twitter
be sure to go to Settings -&gt; Notices and have the notices for followers
and direct messages checked.&lt;br&gt;
3. Set up an account on the unix host for the bot.&lt;br&gt;
4. Login to the account on the unix host.&lt;br&gt;
5. Create the .fetchmailrc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     nano -w .fetchmailrc
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​6. Enter the following lines to that file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     set logfile /home/UNIXACCOUNT/fetchmail.log

     poll &amp;quot;pop.gmail.com&amp;quot; proto POP3 timeout 100 no uidl
     no envelope user &amp;quot;BOTACCOUNT@gmail.com&amp;quot;
     password &amp;quot;BOTPASSWORD&amp;quot; fetchlimit 100 ssl
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​7. Create the logfile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     touch fetchmail.log
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​8. Create the .forward file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     nano -w .forward
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​9. Enter the following line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     |&amp;quot;/home/UNIXACCOUNT/twitterbot.php&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​10. Download [twitterbot.php][], and make it executable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     chmod +x twitterbot.php
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​11. Edit twitterbot.php and enter your Twitter username and password:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     nano twitterbot.php
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;​12. Start up fetchmail in daemon mode and your bot should be
functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;     fetchmail -d 60
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What will happen is that fetchmail will check the email account every 60
seconds. Any email will be downloaded and each message passed to
twitterbot.php. twitterbot.php will examing the headers for the twitter
command and then act accordingly. If it is a new follower, twitterbot
will start following that person. If it is a direct message, twitterbot
will then post that message to the bot's timeline for all its followers
to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email class used for this twitterbot came from &lt;a href="http://phpclasses.elib.com/browse/file/8922.html"&gt;phpclasses.org&lt;/a&gt;,
modified to pull out a few of the X-headers that Twitter adds so the bot
can figure out the type of message and who is sending it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="email"></category><category term="etech"></category><category term="php"></category><category term="twitter"></category></entry><entry><title>Why do students need email?</title><link href="https://ryancollins.org/2008/05/15/why-do-students-need-email/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-05-15T10:12:00-04:00</published><updated>2008-05-15T10:12:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2008-05-15:/2008/05/15/why-do-students-need-email/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;

[![][]][]On the Ohio Technology Coordinator's listserv this question was
posted:

&gt; We already had one case of student to teacher generated e-mail that
&gt; originated on a student computer inside the school. The FIRST question
&gt; I got as the Tech Director was 'Why are you allowing students to send
&gt; and receive email in school?'
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my question would be, "Why are you letting them use pencil and
paper? They could be sending notes to other students or staff!". For
discipline we do not distinguish between computer generated or person
generated correspondence. The punishment may change if it's on the
computer because they'd lose computer privileges due to the AUP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're not going to be able to stop it. A student could simply fire up
&lt;a href="http://ryancollins.org/wp/2008/04/08/sysk-test-your-smtp-mail-server-with-telnet/"&gt;telnet and use your existing mail server to send email&lt;/a&gt; to whoever
they want, saying anything they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No access to telnet on the machine? Then throw up a Java telnet client
on any old web host and access it from there. Actually, if I wanted to
get around a school's filters, this is the route I'd probably go. Once I
get SSH somewhere, I can get full access to the Internet, and it only
requires port 80, a web browser, and Java. (This is what I use at places
that have network access locked down. I open a SSH tunnel over port 443
to my home computer, and then have full access to anything on the
Internet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is email use part of the State of Ohio Technology Standards, it
is our job as teachers to educate the students on the proper use of
email. How to use it, what's appropriate, etc. Part of the problem with
the garbage that students send through email is that they've never seen
anything else. It's pretty foreign for them to see an email message with
proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation. (I hope I have everything
correct in this post! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet you have students right now using a free email services, ssh
tunnels, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like to think we have things locked down, but unless you're working
for the NSA, you do not have it locked down. Education of the students,
punishment for inappropriate behavior is a good way to go. We as
Technology Coordinators we have a habit of putting up technological road
blocks instead of solving the real problems.&lt;/p&gt;

necessary to see what the email server is spitting out, just to make
sure everything is working. The easiest way to do that is to use the
&lt;strong&gt;telnet&lt;/strong&gt; command. Telnet allows you to connect to various services on
remote or local machines through the command line. Today we are going to
be using it to send some email. You'll first need to bring up the
command-line on your respective operating system. First see if telnet is
installed. Type:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And you should see something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Welcome to Microsoft Telnet Client&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Escape Character is 'CTRL+]'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Microsoft Telnet&amp;gt;?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Or this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;telnet&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since that works, type &lt;strong&gt;quit&lt;/strong&gt; to exit telnet. Next, we need to open a
connection to our mail server. We will need to know the name or ip
address of the mail server:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;telnet mail.example.com 25&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(The 25 is the port number that SMTP runs on.) You should then get a
response back from your mail server:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Trying 10.0.0.18... Connected to mail.example.com. Escape character is '^]'. 220 mail.example.com ESMTP Postfix&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The server is now waiting for a command. We need to say Hello. &lt;em&gt;(* For
the remaining examples I'm going to use the domain example.com. You'll
need to replace that with your local domain name. *)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;helo example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Which returns:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;250 mail.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The mail server now needs to know who is sending the email:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mail from: myname@example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Returns:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;250 Ok&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Who are you sending the mail to?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;rcpt to: recipient@example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Returns:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;250 Ok&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now it is time to tell it the message:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Returns:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;354 End data with .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Enter your message:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Subject: test message This is a test message .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To end the message, you need to put a period at the beginning of the
line and hit the return key. Now your message is on its way!&lt;br&gt;
Now type quit to exit&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;quit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
