&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate Microsoft Word. I want Microsoft Word to die. I hate Microsoft Word with a burning, fiery passion. I hate Microsoft Word the way Winston Smith hated Big Brother. Our reasons are, alarmingly, not dissimilar ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Word is a tyrant of the imagination, a petty, unimaginative, inconsistent dictator that is ill-suited to any creative writer's use. Worse: it is a near-monopolist, dominating the word processing field. Its pervasive near-monopoly status has brainwashed software developers to such an extent that few can imagine a word processing tool that exists as anything other than as a shallow imitation of the Redmond Behemoth. But what exactly is wrong with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've moved to formatting with Markdown in most of my writing, with a smattering of Google Docs. I don't remember the last time I used Word (although I do fire up LibreOffice from time to time). In a lot of businesses Word is integrated into a lot of workflows that would be hard to replace. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2013 23:17:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-10-12:2013/10/12/and-you-think-you-know-someone-who-hates-microsoft-word/</guid><category>word</category></item></channel></rss>
