in OS X like Safari, Omniweb, etc. I didn't bother trying to figure out
the problem, until today when I would go to a site in Safari and it
would ask to save the password. I said yes everytime, but it still
didn't save it. Finally I tracked down this blog post, &lt;a href="http://blog.davidohara.net/2007/12/19/os-x-keychain-not-saving-passwords/"&gt;OS X Keychain
Not Saving Passwords…&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggled with this one for about a month before I finally dug into
what was wrong and how to fix it. It all started when I reinstalled
because I couldn’t get BootCamp installed because of volume
fragmentation. Since then, my applications, specifically Mail.app and
Adium, weren’t remembering passwords even if I checked the little
“remember” box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, for some reason, the keychain file at
\~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain was now owned by root instead of by
me. To check and fix from the commandline (&lt;strong&gt;\$&lt;/strong&gt; is the command
prompt):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ls -l ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain -rw-r--r--  1 ryan  admin  781380 Apr  8 11:17 (*deleted...*)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My username is &lt;strong&gt;ryan&lt;/strong&gt;. If it says anything else, use the following to
change the ownership:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ sudo chown ryan ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It will ask for the administrator password, and then change the
ownership of the file. I don't think repair permissions in Disk Utility
would fix this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
