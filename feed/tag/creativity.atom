Combine meetings with interruptions from students, parents, other teachers, and principals, and you have a recipe for grouchy teachers! A person takes 8-10 minutes to get back into a creative state following one interruption. Here are some ideas I had to help you minimize or eliminate interruptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students – Lay down rules on when a student is allowed to ask questions or contribute to a discussion. Create procedures for the student to follow to request help or use the bathroom. One idea to ask for help is to use a simple paper cup. If the cup is on the student’s desk or computer, he would like a moment of your time at your earliest convenience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parents – Notify parents when you are available, and distribute your e-mail address. Let them know they are free to e-mail you at any time. Keep the lines of communication open, but tell them that you are not available to take a call during the day. Sign up for a &lt;a href="http://google.com/voice"&gt;free Google voice account&lt;/a&gt; and give that number out to parents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teachers – A simple thing such as “If the door is closed, email me” can work wonders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Office – Notify the office that you check e-mail twice a day, and that it is your preferred method of communication. Along the same lines, be sure to check your e-mail twice a day!  Follow the idea for teachers above, and close the door when possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Ideas – The best line of defense is a good offense. Let others know what interruptions are acceptable to you. You have e-mail, use it to eliminate as many interruptions as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is to put you in control of your interruptions, and let you take care of them when you have time. Everything above is workable (except for emergencies).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="interruptions"></category><category term="creativity"></category><category term="classroommanagement"></category></entry><entry><title>T3 June 6,2013 - Quitting, the box, and a font</title><link href="//ryancollins.org/2013/06/06/t3-june-6-2013-quitting-the-box-and-a-font/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-06T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-06-06T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-06-06:/2013/06/06/t3-june-6-2013-quitting-the-box-and-a-font/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;In Pursuit of Happiness&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is an impassioned teacher's resignation video. Her speech won't be a revelation for teachers. I'm posting it for those out there who feel the same way, &lt;strong&gt;You're not alone&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One fascinating aspect of watching this on Youtube is the number of &lt;em&gt;I quit&lt;/em&gt; videos from other teachers listed in the &lt;strong&gt;What's related&lt;/strong&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Embrace the box&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ransomtech.edublogs.org/2013/05/29/embrace-the-box/"&gt;Stephen Ransom shares a TED video&lt;/a&gt; in which he reflects on how teachers use limitations as a reason not to do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This font came up on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RichLewis007/status/341935394746667010"&gt;Twitter from RichLewis007&lt;/a&gt;. It's a font like Wingdings, but with icons like you see in apps and on websites. It would make a great addition to your computer, especially if you are creating help sheets for students or teachers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="teaching"></category><category term="fonts"></category><category term="creativity"></category><category term="limitations"></category></entry></feed>
