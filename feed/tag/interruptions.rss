Combine meetings with interruptions from students, parents, other teachers, and principals, and you have a recipe for grouchy teachers! A person takes 8-10 minutes to get back into a creative state following one interruption. Here are some ideas I had to help you minimize or eliminate interruptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students – Lay down rules on when a student is allowed to ask questions or contribute to a discussion. Create procedures for the student to follow to request help or use the bathroom. One idea to ask for help is to use a simple paper cup. If the cup is on the student’s desk or computer, he would like a moment of your time at your earliest convenience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parents – Notify parents when you are available, and distribute your e-mail address. Let them know they are free to e-mail you at any time. Keep the lines of communication open, but tell them that you are not available to take a call during the day. Sign up for a &lt;a href="http://google.com/voice"&gt;free Google voice account&lt;/a&gt; and give that number out to parents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teachers – A simple thing such as “If the door is closed, email me” can work wonders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Office – Notify the office that you check e-mail twice a day, and that it is your preferred method of communication. Along the same lines, be sure to check your e-mail twice a day!  Follow the idea for teachers above, and close the door when possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Ideas – The best line of defense is a good offense. Let others know what interruptions are acceptable to you. You have e-mail, use it to eliminate as many interruptions as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is to put you in control of your interruptions, and let you take care of them when you have time. Everything above is workable (except for emergencies).&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2013 10:39:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-08-26:2013/08/26/dont-interrupt-me/</guid><category>interruptions</category><category>creativity</category><category>classroommanagement</category></item></channel></rss>
