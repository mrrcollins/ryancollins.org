&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found, at both schools, that whenever I bring up the homework issue with teachers or administrators, their response is that they are required by the state to cover a certain amount of material. There are standardized tests, and everyone—students, teachers, schools—is being evaluated on those tests. I’m not interested in the debates over teaching to the test or No Child Left Behind. What I am interested in is what my daughter is doing during those nightly hours between 8 o’clock and midnight, when she finally gets to bed. During the school week, she averages three to four hours of homework a night and six and a half hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three or four hours of homework a night is crazy!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2013 22:20:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-10-11:2013/10/11/see-what-happens-when-a-father-decides-to-do-his-daughters-eight-grade-homework/</guid><category>homework</category><category>memorization</category></item></channel></rss>
