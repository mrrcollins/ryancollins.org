&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in your life, Outlook may be familiar, which we can often confuse with productive or well designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have you been faced with a change in software or hardware, and
just wish you can go back to the old way? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next sentence is just all sorts of awesome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, we can admire the application for its survival, an anachronism of
the now defunct 90s PC era, a pre-web program written at a time when NT Server
terrorized the data center landscape with the confidence of a T-Rex born to
yuppie dinosaur parents who fully bought into the illusion of their son’s utter
uniqueness because the big-mouthed, tiny-armed monster infant could mimic the
gestures of The Itsy-Bitsy Pterodactyl. There was a similar outcry when we
moved away from Outlook’s suite-mates in the Microsoft Office dreadnaught. But
whether it’s familiarity, laziness or simple stubbornness dressed in a cloak of
Ayn Randian Objectivism, the time has come to move on, commrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2013 20:02:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-11-25:2013/11/25/familiarity-doesn-t-always-mean-productive-or-well-designed/</guid><category>productive</category><category>welldesigned</category></item></channel></rss>
