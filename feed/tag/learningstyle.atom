&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been battling the notion of "designing instruction for learning styles" in my own quixotic fashion for a couple of decades now. In my attempt to be a good steward of my clients' shareholders' equity I wished to help them avoid faddish instructional design practices that have been disproven by empirical research. I first learned back in the 1980s at NSPI (now ISPI) conferences that while self-reported learning style preferences do exist, that designing instruction to accommodate them has no basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, research dates back 30 years yet we still hear about accommodating the different learning styles.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="learningstyle"></category></entry></feed>
