&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a recent summer day in Nashville, Kara Teising opened her Facebook page for a lunchtime scroll through her timeline when she discovered a photo posted by her son’s daycare: an image of her 18-month-old son surrounded by other toddlers, their chubby faces glued to a brightly colored, animated screen of an iPad. .... After several discussions with the school’s leadership, Teising and her husband decided to pull their son out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do parents of today hold some ideology of childhood that doesn't include electronics? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shared my theory with Kirkorian –that we parents might idealize a childhood without technology as better. “I often hear ‘grown ups’ talk about the inherent value of ‘real’ objects over technology,” she said, “but frankly I don't see a difference (and there's no research to suggest there is one) between a stick and an iPad. Of course kids should have time to explore the natural environment and interact with other people. A more realistic question is whether an hour or two of touch-screens per day is going to devastate permanently cognitive/social development. It's unlikely, but we just don't know yet, and any answer will depend heavily on program content and the characteristics of individual children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
