&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators, technologists, and campus decision makers who reside in the educational technology bubble speak the ed-tech vernacular like a second language, frequently using words and phrases wholly foreign to many in higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Disagree?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="edtech"></category><category term="buzzwords"></category></entry><entry><title>Current level of technology integration, what is advanced?</title><link href="http://ryancollins.org/2013/10/30/current-level-of-technology-integration-what-is-advanced/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-10-30T21:22:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-10-30:2013/10/30/current-level-of-technology-integration-what-is-advanced/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight on #OETchat the first question was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q1: What do you believe is the current level or state of technology integration in schools &amp;amp; how effective is it? #OETchat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I answered that most were beginners, and some were intermediate. Then I said that none were advanced. Do you know of any districts or schools in Ohio that are advanced with technology integration? Responding to comments I started to try to picture what advanced means. I guess at the basic level advanced means that students are creating more than consuming. Creating in this sense means more than just using an office suite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are other aspects of advanced? Maker spaces? Coding? Digital publishing and story telling? What else?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="edtech"></category><category term="integration"></category></entry><entry><title>Another vision of education in the future</title><link href="http://ryancollins.org/2013/09/07/another-vision-of-education-in-the-future/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-09-07T22:26:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:ryancollins.org,2013-09-07:2013/09/07/another-vision-of-education-in-the-future/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2013/08/map-education-technology-through-2040-infographic"&gt;An Infographic on the future of education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future is about access, anywhere learning and collaboration, both locally and globally. Teaching and learning is going to be social. Schools of the future could have a traditional cohort of students, as well as online only students who live across the country or even the world. Things are already starting to move this way with the emergence of massive open online courses (MOOCs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the future of technology in education is the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infographic is much better than the article linked in the post to the Guardian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near future, native apps are going to become more and more prevalent. That's why Google is putting &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/native-client/"&gt;Native Client&lt;/a&gt; inside of Chrome. And the cloud will be less and less important until cellular companies loosen up the bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. And interactive whiteboards end in 2012...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="future"></category><category term="edtech"></category><category term="technology"></category></entry></feed>
