&lt;p&gt;School had never been challenging for her. She sat in rows with the other students while teachers told the kids what they needed to know. It wasn’t hard to repeat it back, and she got good grades …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 19:48:40 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:ryancollins.org,2013-11-17:/2013/11/17/so-what-do-you-want-to-learn/</guid><category>future</category><category>teaching</category></item><item><title>More on libraries and their future</title><link>https://ryancollins.org/2013/10/18/more-on-libraries-and-their-future/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/67457/surprise-it-s-the-golden-age-of-libraries"&gt;Surprise!

&lt;p&gt;Zachary Loeb (who writes as the Luddbrarian on the blog librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com) notes that "although college students have a huge amount of information available to them, this does not automatically mean that they have acquired all of the information literacy necessary to …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2013 21:47:51 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:ryancollins.org,2013-10-18:/2013/10/18/more-on-libraries-and-their-future/</guid><category>library</category><category>future</category></item><item><title>❂ Libraries are the future</title><link>https://ryancollins.org/2013/10/16/libraries-are-the-future/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/neil-gaiman-future-libraries-reading-daydreaming"&gt;Neil Gaiman: Why our future depends on libraries, reading and daydreaming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was once in New York, and I listened to a talk about the building of private prisons – a huge growth industry in America. The prison industry needs to plan its future growth – how many cells are they going …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2013 20:33:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:ryancollins.org,2013-10-16:/2013/10/16/libraries-are-the-future/</guid><category>libraries</category><category>future</category></item><item><title>Replacing the library</title><link>https://ryancollins.org/2013/10/14/replacing-the-library/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/13/the-end-of-the-library/"&gt;The End Of The Library | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this sucks. Libraries have been an invaluable part of human history, propagating our culture and knowledge over centuries. But recognizing the changing times and pointing out the obvious shouldn’t be considered blasphemy. It is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...the education sector is focusing far too much about what existed yesterday, some about what exists today, and very little about what will exist tomorrow. He challenged the “Choice Architects” of today to stop creating employees for the jobs of yesterday …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2013 21:39:04 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:ryancollins.org,2013-10-13:/2013/10/13/jumping-the-curve-in-education/</guid><category>future</category><category>education</category></item><item><title>Another vision of education in the future</title><link>https://ryancollins.org/2013/09/07/another-vision-of-education-in-the-future/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2013/08/map-education-technology-through-2040-infographic"&gt;An Infographic on the future of education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future is about access, anywhere learning and collaboration, both locally and globally. Teaching and learning is going to be social. Schools of the future could have a traditional cohort of students, as well as online only students who live across the country …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2013 22:26:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:ryancollins.org,2013-09-07:/2013/09/07/another-vision-of-education-in-the-future/</guid><category>future</category><category>edtech</category><category>technology</category></item><item><title>Looking at the classroom of tomorrow</title><link>https://ryancollins.org/2013/09/06/looking-at-the-classroom-of-tomorrow/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thestar.com/life/parent/2013/09/06/technology_transforming_classroom_of_the_future.html"&gt;Technology Transforming the Classroom of the future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology also allows “running before walking” — meaning kids can experiment with concepts way beyond their years, say using an application to design a roller coaster that could actually work. It makes learning subjects like math much more relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
