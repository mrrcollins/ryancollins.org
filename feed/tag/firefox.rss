every so often I try out alternative browsers. A couple of weeks ago I
started to use Chromium (developer builds of Google's Chrome browser)
for OS X and it has now become my default browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has an obsession with speed. In fact, they have found that a .4
second delay in delivering search results causes a 30% drop in click
throughs. They started working on Chrome to deliver a browser that is
fast and secure. It also offers some other advatages such as isolating
each tab or window into separate processes. This means if a tab or
window crashes, it only affects that tab or window. Bookmarks can now be
synched with your Google account, and extensions are starting to become
available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my requirements for a browser is the ability to run multiple
profiles. I have one browser set for personal use and one set for
professional use (I do try to separate the two, although it is difficult
at times). Chrome supports multiple profiles, so now I can launch the
default profile which contains my personal settings and I can launch a
Mr_rcollins profile which contains my professional settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found that Chromium launches faster than any other browser I've
tried. After using it for two weeks, it feels so much quicker than
Firefox 3.5.5.&lt;br /&gt;

since Google hasn't released an official beta yet for OS X.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2009 12:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2009-12-06:2009/12/06/it-feels-like-the-50s-with-all-this-chrome/</guid><category>browser</category><category>chrome</category><category>chromium</category><category>firefox</category><category>Google</category></item><item><title>Firefox 3.0 to be released at 10 PDT (1:00pm for those on the east coast)</title><link>http://ryancollins.org/2008/06/17/firefox-30-to-be-released-at-10-pdt-100pm-for-those-on-the-east-coast/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://getfirefox.com/"&gt;Go and download it&lt;/a&gt;!

still feels a little bit kludgy. If I'm on my MacBook I like to use
Windows Live Writer or Textmate, but Windows Live Writer requires me to
fire up VMware and Textmate seems to also be a little kludgy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've looked at the &lt;a href="http://www.scribefire.com/"&gt;ScribeFire&lt;/a&gt; Firefox extension in the past, when it
was Performancing, but the latest version seems to be almost perfect.
What I've always wanted is to not only post drafts to my blog, but to
also edit the drafts. The latest version of ScribeFire not only allows
me to save my drafts, but I can then re-edit those drafts from
ScribeFire or from Wordpress itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For pictures you can either select a picture on your computer and it
will automatically upload it or you can do a Flickr search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will really be pushing it to my teachers as we increase our blogging
use, and maybe put it on as a global extension on my next disk image for
school.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2008 06:21:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:ryancollins.org,2008-04-23:2008/04/23/maybe-finally-found-the-perfect-blog-editor-2/</guid><category>blog</category><category>firefox</category></item></channel></rss>
