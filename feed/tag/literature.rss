&lt;p&gt;“It’s a really important result,” said Nicholas Humphrey, an evolutionary psychologist who has written extensively about human intelligence, and who was not involved in the research. “That they would have subjects read for three to five minutes and that they would get these results is astonishing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Humphrey, an emeritus professor at Cambridge University’s Darwin College, said he would have expected that reading generally would make people more empathetic and understanding. “But to separate off literary fiction, and to demonstrate that it has different effects from the other forms of reading, is remarkable,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty amazing results from only 3-5 minutes of reading. &lt;/p&gt;
