&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Tough times call for tough actions," he says. So he started selling
ads on his test papers: \$10 for a quiz, \$20 for a chapter test, \$30
for a semester final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting way to deal with cost cutting, but I don't know the
sustainability of the model. Right now the ads are pretty tame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two-thirds of Farber's ads are inspirational messages
underwritten by parents. Others are ads for local businesses, such as
two from a structural engineering firm and one from a dentist who
urges students, "Brace Yourself for a Great Semester!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have sponsorships in the schools with &lt;a href="http://pepsi.com/"&gt;Pepsi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.coca-cola.com/"&gt;Coke&lt;/a&gt;
vying for exclusivity contracts, but once teachers start advertising,
where does it end? Is there oversight of his ads? What happens and a
religious organization wants to advertise?&lt;/p&gt;

Coming soon to a test near you?
